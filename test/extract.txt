The gains of education are never really 
lost. Books may be burned and cities 
sacked, but truth, like the yearning for 
freedom, lives in the hearts of humble men.

Introduction
Following a sharp economic slump at the end of World War I, the decade after the war was one 
of prosperity. Mass production of new products, such as the washing machine, refrigerator, 
and vacuum cleaner, not only made them more affordable, but also contributed to corporate 
profits and business expansion. Despite falling prices in the agriculture sector and economic 
warnings that stock values were grossly inflated and that factories were overproducing, con-
sumer optimism led more and more people to invest their life savings or borrowed money in 
the stock market.
Then, in mid-October of 1929, stock prices began to decline and some investors began to sell 
their positions. The few became the many, and the many led to panic. In less than 2 weeks, 
more than 28 million shares had been sold. The massive selling led the market to crash on 
Tuesday, October 29. The broad-based Depression that followed in the wake of the stock mar-
ket crash had a serious impact on schools. Many were closed, and programs were terminated, 
teacher salaries cut, and positions eliminated.

Section 7.1 
The Depression Begins 
Beginning in 1933, the federal government became actively involved in education through 
New Deal programs that fundamentally changed the relationship between the federal govern-
ment and the schools, one that would become more involved and complex after the Depres-
sion was over.
The experience of the Depression elicited a new interest in social change and social reform. 
One group of social reformers, the so-called Frontier Thinkers, advocated that the schools 
become more involved in the social issues of the time. At the other end of the spectrum were 
essentialists, who argued that progressivism had gone too far by attending to the interests of 
the young child and ignoring basic skills.
As America sought to reverse the economic crisis that gripped the nation in the 1930s, 
Europe faced not only its own depression but also the rise of dictatorships in Italy, Spain, and 
Germany. Meanwhile, in Asia, an expansionist Japan began colonizing portions of China and 
Southeast Asia. America’s attempt to stay neutral in these ominous world affairs ended with 
the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December of 1941. World War II had a heavy impact 
on education. Higher education, in particular, played an important role in preparing person-
nel for military service as well as for the war industries and essential civilian activities.
After the war, public attention that had been focused on the Depression and World War II 
was refocused on the schools, which became the targets of conservative anticommunist witch 
hunts while also being criticized for their lack of rigor and inattention to academics. The 
response to this criticism, as well as to the technological competition that followed the Rus-
sian launching of the spaceship Sputnik in 1957, was a wave of reform supported in part by 
the National Defense Education Act (NDEA).
The NDEA marked not only a significant increase in federal funds to education but also a new 
purpose for education. During the Cold War, for perhaps the first time in American history, the 
role of the schools was seen as not merely to support the war effort, but to be an important 
weapon in it.
The quarter century after the crash of the stock market in 1929 saw major shifts in the role of 
the federal government in education and the role of the schools in securing and maintaining 
the nation’s economic and military preeminence. This chapter provides an overview of the 
events contributing to the transformations of these roles.
7.1 The Depression Begins 
The Great Depression formally began with the stock market crash in October 1929. Among 
the factors contributing to the crash were a trade imbalance following World War I, where 
the United States was exporting more than it was importing to nations that could not pay; 
an unregulated stock market; a weak banking system; growing government expenditures; 
overproduction in both the industrial and agricultural sectors; and growing unemployment.

Section 7.1 
The Depression Begins 
When the stock market crashed, investors lost not only their own life savings, but also the 
money they had borrowed from banks. When they could not repay the banks, the banks could 
not return money to their depositors, who rushed to withdraw “hard cash.” Similar to the rush 
to sell stocks, the rush to the banks caused many of them to crash or close—over 9,000 by 
1933—causing millions of people to lose their life savings.
With the crash of the market and the banks came a collapse in consumer confidence. Those 
with money were reluctant to spend it. Production slowed and, in some areas, ground to a 
halt. The gross national product dropped by almost half between 1929 and 1933. Reduced 
production led to more layoffs and more unemployment, leading to more bankruptcies 
and more people unable to pay their bills. Before it was over, more than 55,000 businesses  
had failed and 13 million people, 25% of the civilian labor force, were unemployed.
Many others were working at much lower wages or reduced hours. Many of the unemployed 
or underemployed became homeless. Unemployment was particularly high among minorities 
and young people. As many as 6 million young people were out of school and unemployed 
between 1933 and 1935. Many had no occupational training or experience. In a labor market 
overrun with experienced workers, they had few opportunities for employment (National 
Policies Commission, 1941).
The initial response of the federal government to the worsening economic conditions and the 
massive unemployment, homelessness, and suffering was to do nothing to provide aid to 
individuals:
People were going hungry, even starving, while farmers were driving sheep 
off cliffs because they could not afford to ship them to market; leather facto-
ries were boarded up while Baltimore teachers collected used shoes so that 
children could come to school; people languished in hovels and tin shacks 
while construction workers stood in soup lines. In the midst of all this, gov-
ernmental leaders before the New Deal seemed incapable of acting to relieve 
the most elemental needs of the people. The governor of West Virginia told 
hungry miners that the Constitution forbade him to give them food. (Tyack, 
Lowe, & Hansot, 1984, p. 14)
At the beginning of the Depression, the Republican president, Herbert Hoover, an advocate of 
limited government, did not believe the federal government should be involved in providing 
direct aid to individuals. He instead looked to private charities and state and local agencies 
to address the needs of the homeless and unemployed. Meanwhile, he directed the resources 
of the federal government toward underwriting banks and providing loans to businesses 
and industries, believing that if they became healthy, then they would rehire employees and 
restart the economy.
However, it was hard to explain to people grubbing on a garbage heap why the president 
would loan $90 million to a single bank in Chicago and at the same time veto a bill to provide 
federal relief to the unemployed (Bortz, n.d.). While not immune to the widespread suffering, 
Hoover, like many others, believed that interfering with businesses, adjusting the currency, 
and providing widespread handouts to individuals were not only steps toward socialism but 
created deficits that would be ruinous in the long term.

Roosevelt’s New Deal, and the rela-
tionship he created between the fed-
eral government and the American 
people, was a dramatic departure from 
Hoover’s policies.

Roosevelt’s New Deal, and the rela-
tionship he created between the fed-
eral government and the American 
people, was a dramatic departure from 
Hoover’s policies.
When Hoover’s policies did not work and economic 
conditions worsened, the voters replaced him with 
a Democrat, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who prom-
ised a “New Deal” for the American people. Over 
the remainder of the decade, Roosevelt initiated a 
series of work relief and public works programs that 
fundamentally changed the relationship between 
the federal government and the American people.
7.2  Impact of the Depression  
on Education 
For the first 2 years following the stock market 
crash, both the public schools and colleges and uni-
versities escaped the brunt of the Depression. In 
fact, from 1929 until 1931 enrollments and staff 
grew and salaries and total expenditures remained 
stable. College fundraising remained high, and in 
the academic year ending in June 1932, colleges and 
universities collected $6.5 million more than they 
did in 1930 (Orr, 1979).
Most school superintendents viewed the current economic condition as a temporary storm 
they could weather by “creative retrenchment” and greater “compactness and efficiency” 
(Tyack et al., 1984). They still had faith in scientific management and the cult of efficiency. 
However, as school districts began to feel the impact of the Depression and educators daily 
saw its impact in the lives of their children, their faith failed and they, like most other Ameri-
cans, began to blame greedy business leaders for the plight of the nation.
Financial Impact
By 1932 education at all levels was in serious financial trouble. College and university enroll-
ments were down, along with student fees and state appropriations. During the 1930s state 
appropriations to higher education declined an average of 40%, even as many private school 
students transferred to more affordable public institutions (Schrecker, 2009). Gift support 
was also down more than 70% at private colleges (Schrecker, 2009).
Colleges and universities responded to the drop in revenues by reducing capital expenditures 
(expenses for building construction and repairs), increasing faculty loads, reorganizing cur-
riculum, hiring freezes, and cutting salaries. A survey by the American Association of Univer-
sity Professors found that 84% of colleges had reduced faculty salaries, sometimes more than 
once, with the average being about 15% (Schrecker, 2009). Public institutions that relied on 
state appropriations suffered the most (Orr, 1979).

Section 7.2 
Impact of the Depression on Education 
Elementary and secondary public schools found themselves in even worse shape than the 
colleges and universities. The public schools competed with other public institutions for tax 
revenues. Those revenues declined, since businesses and homeowners were often seriously 
in arrears in paying property taxes and the unemployed millions paid no taxes at all. By the 
end of the 1933–1934 school year, although total enrollments had increased by 750,000 since 
1930, total revenues were down by almost $278 million (National Center for Education Sta-
tistics [NCES], 1993).
Retrenchment Strategies
The decline in revenues led many states, especially those in the hard-pressed South and South-
west, to close schools or shorten the school year. For example, in Alabama in 1933, 85% of the 
public schools were closed and 7,000 teachers were out of work (Moreo, 1996). By the first 
quarter of 1934, an estimated 20,000 schools nationwide had closed, affecting over 1 million 
pupils. Ten states were estimated to have schools with school terms of less than 3 months and 
22 with terms of less than 6 months (National Education Association [NEA], 1933).
One of the initial retrenchment strategies of the schools was to increase class size, especially 
at the secondary level. In many districts, adult education, summer schools, kindergarten, and 
everything but the most basic subjects were eliminated. Similarly, all but the most necessary 
positions were eliminated. School nurses, supervisory specialists, and elementary principals 
were among the first to go. Schools for the handicapped were also eliminated or radically 
curtailed (Carlson, 1933).
The schools that did stay open were usually short on equipment and supplies. Old and dam-
aged textbooks were the norm. As the Depression deepened, students were increasingly asked 
to bring their own supplies, or, in extreme cases, to pay tuition. In one such community, the 
NEA (1933) reported that 200 parents were unable to pay the $3 per month tuition for grade 
school students or $5.50 for high school students. Some students had to stop attending school 
because they could not afford the materials. Many others were not able to attend because 
they did not have proper clothes or shoes. Testimony before the U.S. Senate estimated that 3.5 
million young people were unable to attend high school because of poverty (Moreo, 1996).
Impact on Teachers
The Depression also had a serious impact on teachers. They were public employees, mostly 
unorganized, and worse, in terms of being able to exercise any political pressure, 80% were 
female and thus particularly vulnerable to arbitrary dismissal on the basis of age, health, mar-
riage, weight, or some minor infraction of a bureaucratic rule (Moreo, 1996).
Being married put women at particular risk. 
Removing more senior married teachers for new, 
unmarried ones was an economic measure as 
well as an attempt to limit the incomes of fami-
lies in which both the husband and wife were 
public employees, as was often the case. Eighteen

Impact of the Depression on Education 
states considered bills to bar married women from teaching, many districts adopted poli-
cies of not hiring married women, and “Married Teachers Not Wanted” signs were common 
(Moreo, 1996).
Throughout the country, most teachers who retained their positions saw their salaries cut. 
Between 1930 and June 1933, the average salary reduction in the cities was 13.7%. Half the 
rural teachers were being paid less than $750 per year, and one in five was receiving less 
than $450 per year (NEA, 1933). In many districts teachers received no salary for months or 
were paid in script (certificates of indebtedness or tax anticipation warrants), with the school 
board promising to pay them when revenues were collected.
Merchants sometimes accepted these warrants, but often did not. Banks might cash the war-
rants but often charged a fee or discounted the warrant. In other areas teachers worked for 
room and board, reverting back to the colonial practice of “boarding ‘round.” In some rural 
areas teachers were reported to live in the schoolhouse and cook gift vegetables on the wood-
burning stove (Graves, 2002; Moreo, 1996).
The response of teachers and other educators to their declining economic conditions and to 
the encroachment on their professionalism was mixed. Some, like the social reconstruction-
ists discussed later in this chapter, called for social engineering through education. Others 
called for school personnel to become more politically active and to organize to fight tax cuts 
and tax policies that unduly favored the business community. Membership in the NEA, AFT, 
and state and local associations grew.
Educators entered the once distained arena of politics as candidates and lobbyists. Most of 
their efforts were directed at the state level, and by and large their campaigns for greater state 
aid were successful: The state share of school budgets almost doubled during the 1930s, from 
16.9% in 1929–1930 to 30.3% in 1939–1940. Teachers also sought greater state regulation of 
certification, greater state oversight of curricula, and greater job protection through teacher 
tenure (Tyack et al., 1984).
Table 7.1 shows the changes in school terms, staff, 
and expenditures for rural and city schools, and the 
percentage of change in expenditures by state uni-
versities, between 1930 and 1934—the time when 
a number of the New Deal programs described 
in the following pages began to reach education. 
Overall, as the data indicate, rural schools in the 
South, Appalachia, and the Dust Bowl (a region in 
the southwestern plains that suffered from intense drought during the 1930s) were particu-
larly hard hit. Higher education expenditures were also heavily affected by the Depression. 
Nationwide, universities decreased their spending by almost 18%; in nine states the decrease 
was 30% or more, and one, Mississippi, had a staggering 81% decrease.
The financial plight of the schools was beyond the ability of most states to solve. In time some 
relief did come from the federal government—not as direct federal aid, but through the series 
of New Deal programs described in the next section.

ers faced during the Great Depression? Do

7.3 New Deal Education Programs 
Until the Great Depression, the relationship of the federal government to education was clear: 
The provision of education was viewed as the responsibility of the states and local school 
districts. However, beginning with the creation of new federal employment programs like 
the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and the Public Works Administration (PWA) in 1933, 
and the National Youth Administration (NYA) of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in 
1935, this established relationship changed.
The New Deal reformers were concerned that the schools did not serve the poor well. So, 
although the New Deal as a whole was not directed at education, each of these New Deal 
programs either had an educational component or worked with the schools to accomplish its

goals. Like other New Deal programs, they were designed specifically for the poor and staffed 
mainly by people on relief. Not designed by education experts, and based on the belief that all 
kinds of people could teach and that learning could take place in all kinds of locations, these 
New Deal ventures constituted a new vision of public education (Tyack et al., 1984).
Civilian Conservation Corps 
The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was one of the federal emergency agencies created 
under Roosevelt’s New Deal to provide “work relief” for the unemployed. It provided tempo-
rary work for over 3 million young men aged 18 to 25, who lived in CCC camps and worked on 
various conservation projects like reforestation, wildlife preservation, flood control, and for-
est fire prevention. Approximately 150,000 African American youth were enrolled in 150 CCC 
companies (Social Welfare History Project, n.d.), and a separate CCC program enrolled 85,000 
Native Americans (Szasz, 2007a). Most of these young people were from rural backgrounds 
and had not finished high school.
Not long after it began, the CCC introduced an educational component for its workers. The 
army, which administered the CCC camps, also administered the education program. Instruc-
tion was provided by Forest Service and army officers, local public school teachers, WPA and 
NYA employees, or other qualified persons, many of whom were volunteers.
Attendance in the classes was voluntary. About one third of the courses were vocational, one 
third were academic, one fifth were remedial, and the remainder were avocational. Many of 
the courses were offered in conjunction with the work of the camps and, being administered 
by the army, stressed discipline along with content (Tyack et al., 1984). By the end of the 
1930s, over 90% of CCC workers were enrolled in some educational program.
National Youth Administration 
The NYA administered two programs: one that provided part-time employment to needy high 
school and college students to help them continue their education and one that provided 
employment to needy out-of-school youth aged 16 to 25. Money was allocated to high schools 
based on the number of children from poor families in attendance. Between 6% and 10% of 
secondary students were in the NYA during its 9 years of operation. They worked in school 
offices, cafeterias, shops, laboratories, and as groundskeepers.
Under the terms of the NYA college student employment program, the college selected the 
students to participate and supervised the work to be done. Approximately 98% of eligible 
institutions, including junior colleges and normal schools, participated in the program, as 
did 12% of all college students. Students worked on research projects, in libraries, in clerical 
positions, and in community service projects.
Sixty percent of the participating students were male, and 6% were African American or from 
other minority groups (Lindley & Lindley, 1938). A special affirmative action fund for prom-
ising African American graduate students enabled about 200 African Americans to receive 
their doctoral degrees during the 1930s, compared to 41 in the period from 1900 to 1930

New Deal Education Programs 
(Tyack et al., 1984). The Division of Negro Affairs in the NYA was headed by Mary McCloud 
Bethune, founder of Bethune-Cookman College, and friend and advisor to President and  
Eleanor Roosevelt.
College enrollment, which had dropped in the first years of the Depression, would have 
dropped further without NYA support of undergraduate and graduate students. At its peak in 
1939–1940, approximately 750,000 students in 1,750 colleges and 28,000 secondary schools 
participated in NYA programs.
The second major NYA work relief program, the one for out-of-school youth, pioneered a new 
concept in education—education through work. That is, 2.7 million youth working in various 
community projects and for various state and local agencies and institutions, as well as in its 
cooperative residential centers, were involved in learning by doing. A boy on a construction 
project might take a related training class on blueprint reading, and a youth on an agricultural 
project might take a class on the chemistry of soils (Tyack et al., 1984).
Public Works Administration 
The Public Works Administration (PWA) was created in 1933 and concentrated on funding 
(it did not do the construction) large-scale public works projects, such as bridges, dams, and 
airports. It also funded the construction of hospitals, libraries, and almost 7,500 schools— 
70% of all schools built between 1933 and 1939.
The PWA was critically important to schools, colleges, and universities faced with not only 
growing enrollments but also unsafe and dilapidated buildings. Between 1934 and 1939,  
$1.7 billion in federal funds (with $300 million state and local matching funds) provided for 
the building of 102 public libraries and 59,614 classrooms (Moreo, 1996). Fourteen percent 
of all PWA funds were spent on school buildings, including the building of 225 Negro schools 
and the renovation of 118 others (Weaver, 1938).
Works Projects Administration 
The WPA was created by Executive Order in 1935 to provide direct federal government 
employment to the unemployed. Whereas the PWA was a lifesaver to schools by providing 
facilities, the Works Projects Administration, the largest of the New Deal programs directed 
specifically at putting men and women back to work, employed 100,000 teachers to serve 
in adult education programs and in the 1,500 WPA-operated preschools across the country. 
The preschools taught some 150,000 children. The WPA also operated summer schools for 
students who had failed subjects during the regular school year, as well as programs that pro-
vided special enrichment activities, including field trips.
The WPA adult education program served as many as 4 million adults, primarily in their own 
communities, in classes taught by unemployed people with similar backgrounds. Perhaps its 
most important feature was the adult literacy program. Between 1933 and 1938, 1.5 million 
adults, about one third of whom were African American, were taught to read. Other adult 
education programs ran the gamut from

cooking and nutrition to family budgeting, personal hygiene, care of the sick 
and other family welfare concerns. . . . All the more remarkable was the fact 
that despite reductions in the number of classes and teachers, enrollments 
continued to climb. In addition, as waves of immigrants fleeing Nazi Germany 
arrived, they immediately sought out classes in English and citizenship train-
ing. (Moreo, 1996, p. 126)
The WPA also employed relief work-
ers to perform a variety of noninstruc-
tional work in the schools. WPA workers 
repaired and painted buildings; con-
structed or repaired furniture, fixtures, 
and equipment; worked in the cafeteria; 
and performed a variety of other tasks.
Another 
important 
noninstructional 
program was the WPA nutrition project, 
which used surplus food to provide free 
hot lunches to needy children, primarily 
in the cities. For example, in New York 
City almost 120,000 free lunches were 
served each day (Moreo, 1996).
General Federal Aid Debate 
Despite the benefits provided by these programs, the general plight of the schools, as well as 
the major inequalities that existed among the states, led the NEA and other educational 
groups to conclude that more federal aid was necessary. The education establishment also 
resented the fact that educators were not trusted to operate the educational components of 
the various New Deal programs and that educational funds were given to the CCC, NYA, and 
the WPA and bypassed established school systems. What educators wanted was general fed-
eral aid with no strings attached.
However, even though they were successful in get-
ting Congressional sponsors for several general 
federal aid bills for education, they were never 
able to secure passage, largely because of Roos-
evelt’s opposition to them. Roosevelt’s lack of sup-
port stemmed less from concern about the poten-
tial impact of general federal aid on the federal 
budget, and more from a genuine belief that com-
pared to other sectors, the schools were in pretty 
good shape. He preferred to target funds to the unemployed and to those who would benefit 
the most from the new educational services (Tyack et al., 1984).

ment to bypass state and local school systems 
in delivering educational programs as they did 
with some of the New Deal programs?

Section 7.4 
The Indian New Deal 
Roosevelt was not alone in his rejection of general 
federal aid. Many educators also opposed it, pri-
marily because of their fear of federal control. This 
fear was so great that some districts rejected all 
federal aid. Many predicted that it would lead to 
a national system of education and would under-
mine local control. Others were concerned that 
aid would (or would not) go to private, parochial 
schools. Perhaps the strongest opposition to general federal aid to education came from the 
Southern governors, who feared that with federal aid would come a demand for uniformity 
that would threaten racial segregation.
Yet, Southern schools, and particularly the rural schools attended by African American chil-
dren already disadvantaged in terms of educational expenditures, were hit particularly hard 
by Depression-driven cuts in funding. A study during the middle of the Depression found 
that in the Southern states African Americans constituted 25% of the student population 
but received only 12% of total revenues. Yet, despite these inequities, the number of African 
Americans attending high school doubled during the 1930s, and the number of graduates 
tripled (Tyack et al., 1984).
The plight of southern African Americans was exceeded only by that of Native Ameri-
cans. Even before the Depression, the 1928 government-commissioned Meriam Report 
documented the intolerable conditions on the reservations. These only grew worse as 
the Depression took hold. The Roosevelt administration’s response became known as the 
Indian New Deal.
7.4 The Indian New Deal 
As described in previous chapters, the education of Native Americans had historically been 
viewed as a means of assimilation. By the end of World War I policies based on this idea had 
brought Native Americans to the edge of disaster: “They were suffering from short life expec-
tancy, disease, malnutrition, a diminishing land base, and a stagnant, unrealistic school sys-
tem” (American Indian Education Foundation [AIEF], 2003, p. 2). The granting of citizenship 
in 1924 did not bring any improvements.
In response to a number of public reports by reformers determined to improve their plight, 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) commissioned the Brookings Institute to undertake an 
independent study of the condition of Native Americans. The institute staff spent 7 months 
visiting reservations, schools, and agencies and in 1928 published its results.
The resultant study, the Meriam Report, recommended more self-determination for Native 
Americans and noted that much Native American poverty was a result of the loss of their 
land and government policies that encouraged them to remain dependent on government 
handouts.
For Your Reflection and Analysis
To what extent are the Depression-era argu-
ments for or against federal aid to education 
relevant today?

Section 7.4 
The Indian New Deal 
The report also criticized the BIA educational program, exposing the boarding schools’ insuf-
ficient industrial training, overcrowded dormitories, inadequate diet, and reliance on physical 
punishment. It recommended that they be reserved only for older children and that younger 
children be educated in community day schools (Kidwell & Swift, 1976). And, consistent with 
the progressive educational views of the author of the education section of the report, W. 
Carson Ryan, it urged that children be educated in a cooperative environment of home and 
school (Watras, 2004).
Soon after Roosevelt took office, he appointed John Collier, a progressive activist, as Commis-
sioner of Indian Affairs. Several New Deal measures were subsequently enacted and collec-
tively became known as the Indian New Deal, an attempt to remedy the conditions described 
by the Meriam Report.
More important, it signaled a reversal of the policy of assimilation. Collier was convinced that 
Indian policy should focus on the renewal of Native American sovereignty, establish their 
economic independence, and recognize and value Native American culture and language. 
Consistent with these beliefs Collier felt the curriculum in the schools should include Native 
American culture and heritage. And, in an effort to stem the deterioration of tribal languages, 
as well as to facilitate English language acquisition, Collier supported bilingual education.
Some of Collier’s earliest efforts were 
directed at stopping the sale of tribal 
land and providing for the organiza-
tion of tribal councils as legal bod-
ies. He believed self-governance was 
central to the economic and political 
recovery of Native American peoples 
and to building a trusting relationship 
between the tribes and the federal gov-
ernment. Many of Collier’s ideas were 
included in the Indian Reorganization 
Act of 1934.
That same year the Johnson-O’Malley 
(JOM) Act was also passed. The JOM 
provided supplemental funds to public 
schools to provide for the special needs 
of Native American students, including 
transportation, school lunches, and 
expenses such as those associated with graduation (Kidwell & Swift, 1976). It also allowed 
the federal government to enter into contracts with states or territories to educate Native 
Americans in the public schools.
Overall, however, Native American education policy was not determined by legislation but 
by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and its director. Collier’s choice as director of the Edu-
cation Division of the BIA was a former president of the Progressive Education Association, 
Willard Beatty. Consistent with progressive principles, Beatty promoted a child-centered

with the chiefs of the Blackfoot Indians in South 
Dakota to discuss the needs of Native Americans.

Efforts to Refocus the Schools and the Curriculum 
curriculum that was more relevant to the culture and needs of the Native American student 
and stressed the importance of the relationship between the school and the community it 
served. Both Collier and Beatty sought to phase out the boarding schools and to replace 
them with public and day schools. During the 1930s the number of day schools almost dou-
bled and enrollment tripled.
Native American education was also the beneficiary of many of the New Deal work relief pro-
grams. Significant funds were allocated through the WPA for the building of hospitals, water 
and sewer treatment plants, irrigation and drainage projects, and much-needed schools. A 
separate Native American CCC known as the Indian Emergency Conservation Work (IECW) 
program was geared to the unique needs of Native Americans and provided a tremendous 
opportunity for vocational training. During the 9-year life of the program (April 1933 to July 
1942) some 85,000 Native Americans served in the IECW (Szasz, 2007a).
Many of the gains made during the New Deal were lost during World War II and after. During 
the war, funds for the reservations decreased. The critics of progressive education found a 
target in the Native American day schools and renewed emphasis was given to assimilation, 
including the continued operation of the off-reservation boarding schools (Watras, 2004).
7.5 Efforts to Refocus the Schools and the Curriculum 
Although the Depression clearly had a major impact on the schools, their governance remained 
the same; what went on behind the schoolhouse door changed little during the Depression. 
In spite of all the talk about, and attempts to introduce, progressive educational practices, 
teacher-centered instruction continued to dominate in the 1930s (Cuban, 1984).
Moreover, the Depression and the New Deal did little to change the inequalities of educational 
opportunity that had characterized the educational experience of the poor and minorities 
throughout American history. For example, in 1930 the national average education expen-
diture per child was $87, per Southern White child $44, and per Southern African American 
child $12 (Moreo, 1996).
Although the states assumed a larger share of public school expenditures, and although state-
supported programs sought to bring greater equalization, the property wealth of the local 
school district remained the major determinant of per pupil expenditures. The low-property-
wealth rural and inner-city schools contained the majority of the poor and minorities. In fact, 
the number of urban poor grew as Dust Bowl migrants and rural Mexican Americans and 
African Americans, displaced from farms, moved to the cities.
Disgust and disagreement with the status quo led some educators to attempt to change the 
direction of the educational enterprise. One such group, the social reconstructionists, wanted 
to see the schools move in a completely new direction and take the lead in creating a new 
social order. Another, the essentialists, wanted the schools to return to the traditional, basic 
education model.

Section 7.5 
Efforts to Refocus the Schools and the Curriculum 
Social Reconstructionism 
The experience of the Depression had a significant impact on many progressive educators, 
who came to believe that the schools had a responsibility to redress social injustices and 
bring about social change. In “Dare the Schools Build a New Social Order?,” an address to the 
1932 convention of the Progressive Education Association that serves as a Primary Source 
Reading for this chapter, George C. Counts, a professor at Columbia University, challenged the 
child-centered progressive philosophy as lacking a theory of social welfare.
Counts called on educators to focus less on the child and more on the social issues of the time, 
to “face squarely and courageously every social issue, come to grips with life in all its stark 
reality . . . develop a realistic and comprehensive theory of welfare, fashion a compelling and 
challenging vision of human destiny” (1932/1978, p. 7). In effect, he asked the schools to take 
the lead in planning for the reconstruction of society and the building of a new social order.
The social reconstructionists, as these like-minded educators were called, were convinced 
that many of the economic ills of the country were a result of an outmoded economic model 
that stressed unbridled competition and individualism, which resulted in tremendous social 
and economic gaps between the rich and the poor. The role of the school, they argued, was to 
guide students in using the tools of the scientific method to study and solve the “real world” 
problems facing our democratic society (Stern & Riley, 2001). What modern technological 
society called for, according to Counts, was a planned society and an economic model built not 
on individualism, but on collectivism.
Liberal progressive educators such as William H. Kilpatrick and Harold Rugg joined Counts in 
his deep concern about socioeconomic conditions in America, his attack on the class bias that 
permeated the schools, and his belief that educators should do something to address them. In 
1935 these individuals joined with other social reformers to form the John Dewey Society for 
the Study of Education and Culture and began publishing a journal, The Social Frontier, which 
became the focus of educational extremism during the 1930s.
The position of the most radical reconstructionists, the so-called Frontier Thinkers, was 
sharply criticized by many conservative progressives and was responsible for a deepening 
schism within the Progressive Education Association and even among the social reconstruc-
tion membership itself. In 1937 Counts left the editorship of The Social Frontier and began to 
speak out openly against communism.
Although the social reconstructionism movement never gained much of a foothold among the 
rank and file of American educators, and The Social Frontier never had a circulation above 
6,000 (Ravitch, 1983), it served to associate progressive education with “an economic radi-
calism that smacked of socialism and communism” and ultimately contributed to progressiv-
ism’s waning popularity in the postwar years (Spring, 1989). However, its concern with social 
change presaged the postmodern and critical theory movements that focused on transforma-
tive change in society and education.

Pioneers in Education: Anne Sullivan
“The Miracle Worker”
Anne Sullivan was born in 1866 in Feeding Hills, Massachusetts, to 
a poor Irish immigrant family. At age 5, she contracted trachoma, 
an eye disease that seriously damaged her vision. Early in her life, 
her mother died and her father abandoned the family. In 1876 Anne 
and her brother were sent to live at the Tewksbury Almshouse for 
the poor, which housed not only the poor and homeless, but also 
prostitutes and the mentally ill. Conditions at the almshouse were 
deplorable, and Anne’s brother died within a few months. When a 
state inspection team visited the almshouse, Anne approached an 
official and pleaded to be allowed to attend a school for the blind.
In 1880, at age 14, Anne was sent to the Perkins School for the Blind 
in Boston, where she first learned to read and write. While at Perkins, 
she also received eye surgery that improved her vision. She learned 
to use the manual alphabet to communicate with Laura Bridgman, a 
resident who was the first deaf-blind person to be educated. Having 
never attended school, Anne lacked social graces, was ridiculed by her 
classmates, and felt insecure and defensive and often displayed a quick 
temper. However, she slowly settled down, excelled at her studies, and 
was chosen valedictorian of her graduating class in June of 1886.
Soon after her graduation, Michael Anagos, the director of Perkins, told her of a contact he had with 
a family in Alabama who wanted a teacher for their deaf, blind, and mute daughter. Anagos recom-
mended Anne for the position. In March of 1887, at the age of 21, Anne traveled to Tuscumbia, 
Alabama, to become the teacher of Helen Keller and to begin their 49-year relationship.
Anne developed her own methods for teaching Helen. Starting with her experience at Perkins and 
with Laura Bridgman, Anne began trying to teach Helen to communicate by spelling words in her 
hand. Helen did not make the association until one day when Anne spelled “water” in one hand 
while running water over the other. Helen then began to realize that these marks being made in her 
hand were associated with water. After that breakthrough Anne’s bright and enthusiastic pupil soon 
learned almost 600 words and the multiplication tables up to 5, as well as how to read Braille. Anne 
wrote long reports and letters to Anagos and others at Perkins, and her success with Helen, which 
was reported by the Perkins school, attracted the attention of such celebrities as Thomas Edison and 
Alexander Graham Bell.
Anne believed that Helen would progress even further if she could attend Perkins, and in 1888 
they traveled to Boston, where Helen enrolled at Perkins and continued to be taught by Anne. For 
several years the pair lived part-time in Boston and part-time in Alabama. In 1900 Helen enrolled in 
Radcliffe College. Anne went with Helen to class, spelling out all lectures and readings into her hand. 
While at Radcliff in 1905 Anne met and married John Albert Macy, who was working with Helen 
on her autobiography. The couple lived with Helen in Massachusetts, and Anne continued to travel 
with her as she made lectures around the country. After Anne’s marriage failed in 1914 and after she 
began to experience health problems, Polly Thomas became Helen’s secretary and the three women 
moved to Forest Hill, New York.
For a number of years, Anne and Helen gave lectures and appeared in vaudeville theaters through-
out the country and abroad tell their story. They also worked and raised funds for organizations 
serving the visually impaired. By the late 1920s Anne had lost most of her vision and had her right 
eye removed to relieve the pain. Before her death in 1936 she was totally blind.
Anne Sullivan’s extraordinary story and relationship with Helen Keller were immortalized in the play 
and film, The Miracle Worker, for which Anne Bancroft won the Academy Award for best actress for 
her role as Anne and Patty Duke best supporting actress for her role as Helen. Anne’s child-centered 
methodology became a model for education of the deaf-blind and her dedication serves as inspiration 
for all teachers of children with disabilities.

The Eight-Year Study 
While progressive education was under attack by the social reconstructionists, it was simulta-
neously being vindicated by a long-term study conducted by the Progressive Education Asso-
ciation under the leadership of Ralph Tyler. The Eight-Year Study (1932–1940) grew out of a 
concern that curriculum revision and experimentation in secondary schools was thwarted by 
college and university admission requirements.
It involved 30 high schools willing to experiment with their curricula in order to discover the 
effectiveness of progressive educational approaches in preparing students for college. Over 
300 colleges agreed to suspend their admission requirements in regard to completion of a 
traditional curriculum for the graduates of these schools. The faculty of the high schools were 
expected to undertake curriculum reform and a few “recreated their programmes to better 
respond to what were perceived as the serious social, economic, and cultural challenges—
’needs’—facing young people in the U.S.A.” (Bullough & Kridel, 2003, p. 153). The revised cur-
ricula delivered the content from the disciplines in an integrated approach organized around 
themes rather than as discrete subjects.
The study followed 1,475 students in matched pairs from high school to college. The results, 
published in 1942, showed that students from experimental high schools not only achieved 
as well as students from traditional high schools, but they were also more involved and suc-
cessful in artistic and cultural activities. Nonetheless, within 8 years of its end, most of the 
experimental schools involved in the study had returned to the traditional college prepara-
tory programs (Watras, 2006).
Although the Eight-Year Study and its findings did not have an immediate impact, its results 
served as the basis for Ralph Tyler, the project director, to develop a theory of curriculum 
development, the Tyler Rationale, which did influence curriculum development for decades. 
Tyler saw curriculum development as a rational process that involved the development of 
objectives and learning activities that facilitated the attainment of the objectives, all inte-
grated from grade to grade and activity to activity (Horn, 2002). The results of the study also 
provided support for the integrated curriculum, a concept that found renewed favor half a 
century later.
William C. Bagley and the Essentialists 
Some of the harshest criticisms of the social reconstructionist wing of progressivism came 
from a group headed by William Bagley, a colleague of Counts’s at Teachers College. Taking 
their name from Bagley’s 1938 speech and publication “An Essentialist Platform for Advance-
ment of American Education,” the essentialists were critical of “extreme” progressive educa-
tion’s lack of emphasis on fundamentals. This included the progressives they believed had 
gone too far in attending to the interests of children while ignoring the basic skills, as well as 
those concerned with social and economic radicalism—that is, the social reconstructionists 
(Null, 2007).
Bagley argued that instead of attempting to reconstruct society and use the schools as 
agents of social engineering, educators would serve society better by preparing “literate 
citizens knowledgeable in fundamental skills and knowledge that was of unquestioned 
value and permanence and that provides the basis for intelligent understanding and for the

collective thought and judgment that are the essence of our democratic institutions” 
(Bagley, 1938, p. 251).
Bagley compared American education with the education systems of other countries such as 
Germany and judged it to be weak, lacking in rigor, full of “frills,” and inadequate in prepar-
ing youth for productive participation in society. Bagley advocated an organized, sequential 
curriculum and an instructional process that, although not ignoring the interests of the child, 
was teacher initiated and emphasized the transmission of those core democratic ideals and 
enduring skills, arts, and sciences that are essential 
for social progress. The essentialists also sought to 
reemphasize the role of the teachers after a period 
when the popularity of informal learning had weak-
ened the profession of teaching (Null, 2007).
As part of this emphasis on teachers, the essential-
ists argued that greater discipline was required in 
the classroom to prepare students for their par-
ticipation in the workforce as well as for their orderly participation in a democratic society. 
In Classroom Management, his widely used book on teacher training, Bagley proposed a very 
rigid and structured classroom environment in which students walked in lockstep to class, 
placed their desks in a prescribed order, and gave immediate response to comments.
At a time when totalitarian regimes were gaining strength in Europe, the essentialists believed 
their movement was part of the battle against totalitarianism. Bagley contended, “[D]emo-
cratic societies cannot survive either competition or conflict with totalitarian states unless 
there is a democratic discipline that will give strength and solidarity in the democratic pur-
pose and ideal” (Bagley, 1938, p. 251).
Many of the essentialists’ criticisms of progressive education—namely, that it was weak, full 
of frills, and a major negative factor in the nation’s position in global economics and military 
competition—have been echoed by critics of the educational establishment ever since. The 
reform reports of the 1980s and 1990s used much of the essentialists’ language, although in 
the context of political mandates to solve perceived system problems, not as philosophical 
statements of the purpose of the curriculum and the training of teachers (Null, 2007).
7.6 Impact of the Second World War on the Schools 
Germany’s invasion of Poland in September of 1939 marked the beginning of World  
War II. Although it would be more than 2 years before America formally entered the war, 
America’s Lend-Lease agreement with the Allies meant that American factories increas-
ingly were called on to supply the Allied war effort. This helped the American economy 
recover from the Depression.
The threat of impending war also led educational institutions at all levels to address the task 
of promoting education for national defense. Before the United States became involved in 
the war, this meant education to strengthen the foundations of democracy. After the Japa-
nese attack on Pearl Harbor, this meant using education resources to promote the war effort  
(Kandel, 1948).
For Your Reflection and Analysis 
Would Bagley be supportive of the seven cardi-
nal principles of secondary education described 
in Chapter 5? Why or why not?

Section 7.6 
Impact of the Second World War on the Schools 
The joint Education Policy Commission (1942) of the NEA and the American Association of 
School Administrators suggested that the federal government establish an agency to facilitate 
and coordinate the interaction of government agencies with schools and colleges. The gov-
ernment responded by establishing the U.S. Office of Education (USOE) Wartime Commission.
The Commission did not mandate that specific courses be taught in the schools as part of the 
war effort. However, in its report, The Best Kind of High School Training for Military Service, it 
did outline the type of educational program that would provide the most valuable preinduc-
tion training for future members of the armed services. Basically, the commission recom-
mended that the schools emphasize health and physical fitness, education for citizenship, the 
academic subjects, and specialized training in vocational skills.
The government had forecast that 80% of the 1.3 million high school males between 16 
and 18 years of age would enter the armed forces soon after graduation (Ugland, 1979). Six 
months after Pearl Harbor the war activities of high school youth were brought into focus by 
the establishment of the High School Victory Corps, a federal program organized by the USOE 
to encourage instruction and training in pursuits and services needed in wartime.
In addition to their curricular pursuits, Victory Corps members were required to participate 
in at least one wartime activity or service (for example, air warden, fire watcher, civil defense 
volunteer, USO volunteer, or home-school-community services such as salvage campaigns). 
The USOE hoped that the Victory Corps would give substance to the idea of the student 
reservist and preinduction training and saw this as a way to have a prominent spot in the war 
effort (Ugland, 1979).
However, most schools were realistic about what they could provide in terms of such training. 
Although they did follow the advice of the USOE and gave more attention to applied math-
ematics and science, manual and industrial arts, and vocational education, they also contin-
ued to offer a strong academic curriculum. This was due in part to the fact that most of the 
students who left school to take jobs in the war industries were not headed for college, and 
those that remained in school were reluctant to depart dramatically from an academic cur-
riculum (Ugland, 1979).
For what were undoubtedly a variety of reasons, the Victory Corps was less successful than 
its creators had envisioned. One year after its inception less than 25% of eligible students had 
joined. Enrollment subsequently declined, and the next year the program was discontinued. 
Nonetheless, the Victory Corps program did have an effect on the curriculum. In combina-
tion with the emphasis on preinduction training and the support given vocational training, it 
served to shape the wartime curriculum toward “education for victory.”
Impact of the War on Elementary and Secondary Schools 
The war had a heavy impact on schools, teachers, and students. (The impact on one special 
group of students, Japanese Americans in relocation camps, is the subject of one of the Pri-
mary Source Readings for this chapter.) High school enrollments declined from 6.7 million 
in 1940–1941 to 5.5 million in 1943–1944. Despite “Go-to-School” drives, it was difficult for 
the 80% of students who did not plan to go to college to resist either the call to arms or the 
high wages to be found in the wartime industries. And, even though enrollment declined, the

Section 7.6 
Impact of the Second World War on the Schools 
teacher shortage that had begun before the war worsened. Not only did large numbers of 
teachers leave the classroom for the battlefield, but many more, especially women, left to take 
higher paying positions in industry.
The shortage of teachers, which some historians consider to be the most serious consequence 
of the war, was felt during the postwar years as well (Kandel, 1948). By the end of the war, 
more than one third (350,000) of the teachers employed in 1940–1941 had left teaching 
(Kandel, 1948). Teacher shortages occurred both in the subject matter fields that might be 
expected and in rural and other areas where salaries were far below those paid in the war-
time industries.
The results of the teacher shortages were similar to those experienced during the Depression: 
school closures, reduced terms, and fewer course offerings. By the middle of 1943 the teacher 
shortage was seen as a threat to the students still in school. Moreover, it was projected that it 
would take a decade to make up the deficit created by the teachers leaving the profession and 
the decline in enrollment in teacher education programs (Kandel, 1948).
The one area of schooling that did not experience enrollment decline during the war was 
early childhood education. The federal government allocated more than $50 million for the 
construction and operation of more than 3,000 nursery schools nationwide, primarily to 
serve the 2- to 5-year-old children of military families or working mothers (Dorn, 2007). 
Additionally, states and cities joined in the provision of preschool programs that were of a 
higher quality than the federally sponsored welfare programs of the past (Dorn, 2007).
Another major impact of the war on 
the schools was financial. Funding, 
already low because of the Depres-
sion, was further reduced as money 
was diverted from education to other 
purposes. Once again these financial 
difficulties highlighted the inequali-
ties of educational opportunity that 
existed among regions and districts. 
Reports from the Selective Service on 
the young men rejected for mental and 
physical deficiencies showed higher 
percentages coming from the predom-
inantly rural and Southern states, the 
same areas that had the lowest educa-
tional expenditures.
The inequalities and their conse-
quences intensified the arguments for 
federal support for education. Some 
financial assistance was provided to 
those school districts overburdened 
by an influx of children from families employed in defense industries or on military bases 
by the Lanham Act of 1941. This so-called impact aid was continued under the provisions of 
Public Laws 815 and 874.

While teachers and students were leaving the second-
ary and elementary schools, nursery schools, like the 
one shown here, experienced steady levels of enroll-
ment due to the increase of working mothers during 
the war.

Section 7.6 
Impact of the Second World War on the Schools 
A major war-related initiative sponsored by the federal government was the Vocational-
Defense Training Program, later known as the Vocational Training for War Production Work-
ers. Through this program over 5 million people received training in war occupations at pub-
lic vocational schools. Training was provided to people already employed in war occupations 
who needed additional skills or knowledge to equip them for more advanced positions, and 
preemployment training was provided to unemployed persons or persons employed in non-
war occupations.
One part of the program was designed to provide training to youth, especially rural youth, 
to assist in the production of food for the war effort. Later called the Food Production War 
Training Program and extended to include adults, the program enrolled 2.8 million people in 
courses such as Farm Machinery and Equipment Repair; Construction, Food Conservation-
ism, and Preservation; and a variety of other topics designed to help reach the wartime food 
production goals (Henry, 1945b).
Impact of the War on Higher Education 
Colleges and universities were also seriously affected by the war. Enrollment declined sharply, 
as almost 75% of male students went into military service. The instructional staff was also 
severely reduced as instructors left for military service, to perform research related to the 
war effort, to enter the diplomatic service, or to provide expertise and service in the monu-
mental task of conversion of industries from peacetime to wartime.
Even college and university athletics were affected by the war. Many institutions reduced or 
suspended their sports programs. “Even such high profile national events as the Rose Bowl 
game were altered to accommodate the national emergency, with the traditional New Year’s 
Day game being moved out of harm’s way from Pasadena, California to Durham, North Caro-
lina” (Thelin, 2004, p. 257). One institution’s apparent suspension of athletics had a more 
serious purpose: Underneath the deteriorating and overgrown football stadium at the Uni-
versity of Chicago was a secret site of the Manhattan Project, the massive federal program to 
develop the atomic bomb. Labs were constructed in the locker rooms under the grandstands 
(Thelin, 2004).
Institutional finances were also affected by the war. Income in 1943–1944 was only 67% of 
what it had been in 1939–1940 (Knight, 1952). Larger institutions involved in the specialized 
training described below or in government-sponsored research were not as heavily affected 
as smaller institutions, but all institutions faced increased costs for current operations  
(Kandel, 1948).
The impact of the reductions in enrollments, staff, and finances on the nation’s colleges and 
universities was so serious that toward the end of the war, Congress authorized a study of the 
effects of these reductions as well as the projected impact of the phasing out of the special-
ized training programs being conducted on college campuses. The results of the study led the 
committee to recommend emergency federal aid to assist higher education.
A bill introduced in May 1945 to provide this aid did not pass, but the next year President 
Harry Truman appointed the President’s Commission on Higher Education in a Democracy 
to consider the future of the nation’s higher education system. Among the recommendations

Section 7.6 
Impact of the Second World War on the Schools 
made by the committee in 1947 was that the federal government continue to provide fund-
ing for research. Not only was this done, but in addition the magnitude of these vast research 
enterprises served to transform many universities into what Clark Kerr (1963) termed “fed-
eral grant universities.”
Higher Education and the War Effort 
Individually, and through the American Council on Education, colleges and universities sought 
to play an active role in the war effort. They were intent on ensuring that the mistakes of 
World War I not be repeated. At the outbreak of that war, the War Department had no plan for 
involving colleges and universities in the war effort, and when it finally did, it effectively took 
over college campuses. Officials also lacked plans for training scientific and technical person-
nel and indiscriminately drafted faculty into the armed services to serve in roles that made no 
use of their academic training and talents (Cardozier, 1993).
As World War II loomed and then overtook the United States, colleges, college students, and 
the war department were faced with a dilemma: They recognized that the future need for 
professionally trained individuals demanded that college students remain in school and that 
college professors remain in their positions, but at the same time these were the very indi-
viduals who were required for positions of leadership in military and government service.
One way colleges and universities attempted to meet the manpower demand was by accelera-
tion: moving to 4 quarters or 3 semesters and to a 6-day instructional week. This made gradu-
ation possible in 3 years. Even medical schools adopted accelerated programs that reduced 
the length of medical preparation to 3 years.
One of the most important roles played by colleges 
and universities during the war was preparing 
men for military service, for war industries, and 
for essential civilian activities. By the end of 1943, 
380,000 men were involved in specialized training 
at 489 colleges and universities, many as part of 
the Army Specialized Training Program, the Army 
Air Force College Training Program, or the Naval 
College Training Program (Knight, 1952). In each 
case the particular branch of service contracted with the college or university to use its facili-
ties and faculties to provide specialized training that its own training facilities were not pre-
pared to deliver.
In addition to on-campus training of military personnel, over 100,000 servicemen and women 
enrolled in correspondence courses for high school or college credit that were supplied by the 
United States Armed Forces Institute in cooperation with more than 800 colleges and univer-
sities (Henry, 1945a). These experiences, and the continued interest of military personnel in 
higher education in the postwar period, were major factors in the postwar boom in higher 
education enrollment.
Training for civilian personnel in areas deemed important to the war effort was provided 
through the Engineering, Science, and Management Defense (later War) Training Program 
operated cooperatively by the United States Office of Education and participating colleges

Section 7.6 
Impact of the Second World War on the Schools 
From the Archives: Education’s Part in the War Effort
This 1946 statement issued by the National Education Association provides statistics about educa-
tion’s involvement in the war effort.
The schools and colleges of the United States made indispensable contributions to 
the nation’s war effort. Among other things they
(1) Laid the foundations upon which a citizens’ army was quickly built. In World War 
I only 20% of the members of the armed forces had more than an eighth-grade edu-
cation; in World War II, almost 70% had more than an eighth-grade education. . . .
(4) Carried through a training program designed to increase industrial production 
and the supply of food. Pre-employment courses were given to 2,667,000, supple-
mentary vocational courses to 4,800,000, and agricultural training to 4,188,000 
students.
(5) Registered millions of men for the Selective Service. In most communities school 
buildings were used and thousands of teachers voluntarily gave time as registration 
clerks.
(6) Registered citizens and distributed 415,000,000 ration books. Many teachers 
served on the rationing boards—in August 1945, of the 126,000 board members 
nearly 7,600 were educators.
(7) Participated in the drives to collect waste paper and metal. Out of 25,000,000 
tons of paper collected, it is estimated by authorities that the schools collected at 
least 2,500,000 tons.
(continued)
and universities. The program supported 12- to 16-week courses designed to address the 
shortage of engineers, chemists, physicists, and production supervisors in the specialties 
important to the war effort.
The program also provided war courses for high school physics and math teachers as part of 
the government’s efforts to promote preinduction courses in the high schools. Between the 
end of 1943 and October 1945, more than 1.3 million men and women enrolled in 12,500 
short courses offered by over 200 colleges in 1,000 towns and cities across the country (Kan-
del, 1948).
Alongside these training functions, one of the most important contributions of universities to 
the war effort was to conduct government-sponsored large-scale applied research. The effec-
tiveness of universities with these projects had an enduring legacy and provided the founda-
tion for future partnerships between universities and the federal government in a way that 
would “indelibly transform the missions and funding of American higher education” (Thelin, 
2004, p. 259).
Although it is not possible to cite all the contributions the schools, colleges, and teachers 
made to the war effort, the statement of “Education’s Part in the War Effort” issued by the 
National Education Association in 1946 and presented in the From the Archives feature box 
enumerates some that have not been mentioned in this discussion.

(8) Sold two billion dollars worth of war bonds and stamps. In 1945 more than 
25,000,000 pupils were participating in school savings plans as compared to 
2,500,000 in 1941.
(9) Provided headquarters for civilian defense activities. Partial reports from city 
school systems indicate that one in ten teachers participated in such activities.
(10) Assisted the Junior Red Cross to produce over 35,000,000 comfort and rec-
reational articles for the armed forces. In addition, medical chests, dried milk, and 
educational gift boxes were sent to children in the war zones.
(11) Gave thousands of hours to war-supporting agencies. Among these were the 
United Service Organizations, American Red Cross, war relief drives for our Allies, 
book drives of the American Library Association, and nursery schools and child-care 
programs.

7.7 Education in the Postwar Era 
Enrollment in public schools and higher education surged in the postwar years. Toward the 
end of the war, in an effort to assist veterans whose schooling had been interrupted by mili-
tary service, Congress passed the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944. The G.I. Bill , as it 
became known, provided benefits to 7.8 million veterans of World War II to help them further 
their education at any level. In 1947 more than 1 million veterans were enrolled in college, 
approximately 48% of the total enrollment of 2.4 million (Kim & Rury, 2007). The law’s ben-
efits were subsequently extended to veterans of the Korean, “Cold,” and Vietnam wars; even-
tually almost 15 million veterans received aid.
The G.I. Bill also initiated a great postwar popularization of higher education. As going to 
college became more common, it provided an incentive to high school students to graduate, 
and the growing number of high school graduates swelled college enrollments even further 
(Kim & Rury, 2007). In the decade from 1949 to 1959 higher education enrollment increased 
35%, and it more than doubled in the next decade, from under 4 million to over 8 million (see 
Table 7.2). In addition to absolute growth, in the decades after the war, more men and women 
representing a greater age range and from more varied social, economic, cultural, and racial 
groups attended colleges and universities than ever before (Cremin, 1988).

While returning servicemen filled college and university classrooms after the war, within a 
decade, the postwar “baby boom” (by 1965 over 40% of Americans were under the age of 20) 
hit the public schools. Between 1946 and 1956 kindergarten and elementary school enroll-
ments increased 37%, from 17.7 million to 24.3 million.
Life Adjustment Education and the Education Critics of the 1950s
The years after World War II constituted a period of not only burgeoning enrollments, but 
also adjustment—the adjustment of returning servicemen and women; the adjustment of the 
economy from wartime to peacetime; the adjustment to life in a new residential configura-
tion, the suburb; and the adjustment to a society that was more transient, more mobile, and 
more prosperous than ever before (Gutek, 1981). In the midst of postwar changes and uncer-
tainties an education movement called life adjustment education came into prominence. 
Life adjustment education became associated with progressive education and became the 
target of a group of critics who held progressive education responsible for a perceived decline 
in educational standards.
Life adjustment education was formally introduced in 1945 at a vocational education confer-
ence sponsored by the U.S. Office of Education. It offered a program adjusted to the interests, 
efforts, and probable future activities of those 60% of students not entering vocational train-
ing or preparing for college.
Life adjustment education proposed
curriculum flexibility; student guidance; and attention to previously neglected 
areas of social living such as hygiene, family living, drivers’ education and 
social relations with peers. Emphasis was upon increasing the holding power 
of American high schools by presenting students with a more meaningful and 
relevant curriculum. (Fallace, 2011, p. 575)
For Your Reflection and Analysis 
Give arguments for and against life adjustment 
education as a tool for making education more 
relevant for all students.

While returning servicemen filled college and university classrooms after the war, within a 
decade, the postwar “baby boom” (by 1965 over 40% of Americans were under the age of 20) 
hit the public schools. Between 1946 and 1956 kindergarten and elementary school enroll-
ments increased 37%, from 17.7 million to 24.3 million.
Life Adjustment Education and the Education Critics of the 1950s
The years after World War II constituted a period of not only burgeoning enrollments, but 
also adjustment—the adjustment of returning servicemen and women; the adjustment of the 
economy from wartime to peacetime; the adjustment to life in a new residential configura-
tion, the suburb; and the adjustment to a society that was more transient, more mobile, and 
more prosperous than ever before (Gutek, 1981). In the midst of postwar changes and uncer-
tainties an education movement called life adjustment education came into prominence. 
Life adjustment education became associated with progressive education and became the 
target of a group of critics who held progressive education responsible for a perceived decline 
in educational standards.
Life adjustment education was formally introduced in 1945 at a vocational education confer-
ence sponsored by the U.S. Office of Education. It offered a program adjusted to the interests, 
efforts, and probable future activities of those 60% of students not entering vocational train-
ing or preparing for college.
Life adjustment education proposed
curriculum flexibility; student guidance; and attention to previously neglected 
areas of social living such as hygiene, family living, drivers’ education and 
social relations with peers. Emphasis was upon increasing the holding power 
of American high schools by presenting students with a more meaningful and 
relevant curriculum. (Fallace, 2011, p. 575)
For Your Reflection and Analysis 
Give arguments for and against life adjustment 
education as a tool for making education more 
relevant for all students.
Spurred on by a series of conferences, state and national commissions, and numerous publi-
cations, it was seen by many as a natural outgrowth of progressive education’s goal of mak-
ing the schools more relevant to the broad spectrum of students. Although other approaches 
to creating a more functional curriculum had been advanced during the 1930s and 1940s, 
none gained the favor that life adjustment education did. In less than a decade after its formal 
introduction, half the states had undertaken some variation of the life adjustment curriculum.
Critics of progressive education saw life adjust-
ment education as a perfect target. Most of the 
criticism came from academic traditionalists who 
viewed the proposed reform program as a par-
ticularly dangerous form of anti-intellectualism 
(Wraga, 2010). “It continued an abundance of slo-
gans, jargon, and various anti-intellectualisms; it 
carried the utilitarianism and group conformism 
of latter-day progressivism to its ultimate trivial-
ization” (Ravitch, 1983, p. 70).
One of the foremost critics of life adjustment education and progressive education in the post-
war period was Arthur Bestor, a professor at the University of Illinois. In his most famous 
critical study, Educational Wastelands (1953), Bestor deplored the anti-intellectual quality of 
American schools, which he claimed had been caused by progressive educators who “set forth 
purposes of education so trivial as to forfeit the respect of thoughtful men, and by deliberately 
divorcing the schools from the disciplines of science and scholarship” (p. 10).
He also rejected what he claimed was life adjustment education’s implication that 60% of 
students would not benefit from intellectual training as invalidating “most of the assumptions 
that have underlain American democracy” (Bestor, 1953, p. 82).
Bestor advocated a return to basics—a traditional liberal arts curriculum of well-defined 
intellectual disciplines and the development of the intellect as the primary goal of education. 
Like earlier essentialists, Bestor (1956) argued that such a curriculum should be systematic 
and sequential because “clear thinking is systematic thinking, [and] liberal education involves 
the logical organization of knowledge” (p. 36). Bestor’s criticisms were well received by con-
servatives and other opponents of progressive education, and he was widely publicized in the 
popular press.
Beset by its critics, life adjustment education faded  
from the education scene as the United States 
became preoccupied with competition in the Cold 
War. However, criticism of progressive education 
continued. Two of the leading critics of progres-
sive education were Robert Hutchins and Admiral 
Hyman G. Rickover, father of the atomic submarine. 
Similar to Bestor, Hutchins advocated a return to a 
more traditional curriculum, though he preferred 
the classical liberal arts curriculum. Consistent with the perennialist educational philoso-
phy, Hutchins argued that the ideal education is one that is designed to cultivate the intellect 
and that this could best be done by a curriculum that concentrates on the Great Books of  
Western civilization.
For Your Reflection and Analysis 
In what ways does Bestor’s traditional liberal 
arts curriculum reflect the educational philoso-
phy of the “back to basics movement”?

Section 7.7 
Education in the Postwar Era 
Perhaps even more critical of progressivism was Admiral Rickover (1959), who judged it to 
be “as hopelessly outdated today as the horse and buggy” and declared that “nothing short 
of a complete reorganization of American education, preceded by a revolutionary reversal of 
educational aims, can equip us for winning the educational race with the Russians” (p. 188).
Rickover’s criticism of America’s schools was based largely on comparisons to their European 
counterparts. Based on this comparison, Rickover concluded, as had Bestor, that a liberal arts 
education provided the intellectual discipline needed for critical thinking and problem solv-
ing as well as advanced specialized training. He also favored the multitrack, ability group-
ing of most European educational systems to the American comprehensive high school. He 
focused his attention on the academically talented, who he believed were central to maintain-
ing America’s competitive edge with the Soviets.
At the same time that progressivism was coming under attack for its association with life 
adjustment education, the deepening Cold War brought growing intolerance for progressive 
ideals. Progressivism was associated with liberal politics, and progressive textbooks that pro-
moted international understanding and discussed socialism and communism were attacked 
by right-wing groups as being un-American (Bernard & Mondale, 2001a).
However, in the end it was not its critics that killed progressive education. Rather, it was a 
victim of both its own successes and its failures. On the one hand, much of what the progres-
sives had initially advocated had been incorporated into the schools. Projects, activities, and 
pupil experiences had been intelligently integrated into subject-matter teaching; concern for 
health and vocation had gained a permanent place in the school program; and concern for the 
individual differences among children had replaced the lockstep institution and rote memo-
rization (Ravitch, 1983).
On the other hand, progressive education failed to recognize the extremism of its unrelenting 
rejection of the traditional curriculum and failed to give adequate attention to the critical issues 
facing education in the 1930s and 1940s (Graham, 1967). Essentially, progressive education 
did not seem to be relevant to the time. When the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first space 
satellite, in 1957, the nation suddenly became concerned with intelligence and the need for 
increased science and mathematics skills, and progressive education seemed out of step.
The Montessori Movement
Concerns about academic standards, and in particular the demands of parents searching for 
more academically oriented early childhood programs than those offered by most public 
schools, contributed to a revival of an approach to early childhood education developed by 
Italian physician (the first female Italian physician) and educator Marie Montessori. Devel-
oped in the early 1900s and based on her work with children with developmental and intel-
lectual disabilities in the slums of Rome, news of the Montessori method and its successes 
soon spread worldwide. The first Montessori school opened in the United States in 1911 in 
Scarborough, New York, and many others followed; more than 100 were in operation in 22 
states by 1915.
Despite its initial popularity, the Montessori movement quickly faded. World War I travel 
restrictions, anti-immigrant sentiment, and the distain of several influential educators all 
contributed to the decline (American Montessori Society, 2013). William Kilpatrick, Dewey’s

colleague at Teachers College, was particularly critical of Montessori’s methods. In The Mon-
tessori System Examined (1914) Kilpatrick declared her work to be based on a psychological 
theory that was “50 years behind the times” (Thayer-Bacon, 2012, p. 4).
Renewed interest in the Montessori movement in the 1950s, however, spread quickly in 
the United States. The Montessori system calls for free activity within a prescribed range of 
options and within a prescribed environment that supports the child’s natural curiosity and 
encourages collaborative learning. It includes the use of didactic sensory materials (such as 
sandpaper letters and numbers) and other specifically designed practical activities concerned 
with social skills, personal health and hygiene, the environment, and self-discipline.
Thousands of schools worldwide declare themselves to be “Montessori Schools.” However, 
since the courts have ruled that the term “Montessori School” is not copyrighted, potentially 
virtually any school can call itself a Montessori school, and they vary in quality as well as 
methodology. Some represent the early Montessori method that was more flexible, adaptable, 
and open to scientific experimentation, while others represent a more structured system that 
assumes that experimentation is over (Thayer-Bacon, 2012).
7.8 Curriculum Reform in the Aftermath of Sputnik 
Few times in history has a single event had such an impact on education as the launching of 
Sputnik in October 1957. The success of the Soviet space satellite seemed to confirm fears 
that the United States was losing the Cold War’s technological and military races. The fear of 
hydrogen bombs being dropped from a similar craft onto American cities was matched by the 
humiliation and loss of prestige from being forced into second place in a critically important 
area of science and technology (McGrath, 1958).
The popular theory that emerged as a result was that the Russians beat the United States into 
space because the American school curriculum lacked rigor and paid insufficient attention to 
math and science. Concerned Americans also highlighted the consequences of the decades-
long underfunding and neglect of education, noting that at the time of the launching of Sput-
nik, there was a reported shortage of 135,000 teachers and 159,000 classrooms. Many more 
thousands of teachers operated on temporary or emergency certificates. Some classes in the 
larger cities held 40 or more children, and 800,000 children nationwide attended school for 
only half the day (McGrath, 1958).
While the launching of Sputnik was a political-military problem, education was seen as a 
major part of the solution. Ideas for educational reform were taken from business and indus-
try, such as proposals to standardize the curriculum in such a way that “anyone could teach to 
any group of students” and to increase the output of scientists and mathematicians (Steeves, 
Bernhardt, Burns, & Lombard, 2009, p. 78).
The Federal Response
The federal government’s response to Sputnik was significant in both its magnitude and its 
direction. In effect, the government became directly involved in education reform and initiated 
a national curriculum in the areas of mathematics, science, and modern foreign languages.

Curriculum Reform in the Aftermath of Sputnik
Tools of the Trade: 1960 Physics Text and “Frames of Reference” 
Video Prepared by the Physical Science Study Committee
One of the groups preparing curriculum materials to upgrade high school mathematics and science 
programs in response to the launch of Sputnik was the Physical Science Study Committee. With the 
support of the National Science Foundation, the committee prepared a physics textbook intended to 
make physics more interesting to students and to promote understanding of its principles, not just 
rote memorization.
The first edition of the text, Physics, appeared in 1960, and it was published for many years to come. 
Teachers’ guides, films, tests, and recommendations on the creation and use of “inexpensive experi-
mental apparatus” accompanied the text (MIT Institute Archives & Special Collections, 2012).
Sample pages from the “PSSC Physics Teacher’s Guide, Advanced Topics” can be reviewed at http://
libraries.mit.edu/_archives/exhibits/pssc.
One of the more interesting (and humorous) PSSC films, “Frames of Reference” (1960), which 
features two university professors demonstrating the difference between inertial and noninertial 
forces can be viewed at: https://archive.org/details/frames_of_reference.
This was accomplished not by mandate but by support for the development of new curricular 
materials, the distribution of money to school districts to purchase the new materials and 
equipment, the training of teachers in the use of the new materials and methods, and student 
loans and fellowship programs.
Federal support for the development of math and sciences curricula came through funding 
provided through the National Science Foundation (NSF). Support for the development of a 
language curriculum came through the National Defense Education Act of 1958 (NDEA).
The NDEA also provided support for students preparing for careers in science, mathemat-
ics, foreign languages, and engineering; the hiring of science teachers and the purchase of 
scientific equipment and supplies; the improvement of guidance, counseling, and testing pro-
grams, especially those directed at the identification and encouragement of more capable 
students; foreign language institutes and laboratories; and increased funding to the NSF.
The fivefold increase in funding to the NSF allowed it to expand its curriculum development 
and education programs. In 1956 it established the Physical Science Study Committee (PSSC), 
composed of a number of prestigious scientists. Federal support for the work of the PSSC 
allowed it, beginning in 1958, to spend over $1 million per year for several years on the devel-
opment of curriculum materials for high school physics.
Classroom teachers were introduced to the PSSC materials through summer institutes con-
ducted at institutions of higher education under contract with the NSF, as well as through in-
service institutes. Teachers were given a stipend and sometimes academic credit to attend the 
institutes. After the passage of the NDEA, school districts could use grant funds to purchase 
PSSC materials. Within a couple of years, the manufacture and distribution of PSSC materials 
had been turned over to private companies.

Section 7.8 
Curriculum Reform in the Aftermath of Sputnik
Another NSF group, the School Mathematics Study Group (SMSG), was organized in 1958 and 
developed the “new math,” which was based on set theory. A set was
any collection of things, which could be points, lines, vectors, or any philo-
sophical notion, such as brotherhood. By thinking in terms of sets, children 
were to learn to understand relationships and discover hidden patterns. Sup-
posedly, after developing this habit of thinking, the student would retain a 
mental discipline that would be useful in advanced mathematical techniques. 
(Spring, 1989, p. 82)
The SMSG developed a series of widely used mathematics textbooks. The group’s stated pur-
pose was not to compete with commercial publishers but to ensure that its curriculum was 
being used in schools. Accordingly, the SMSG established a committee to review commercial 
math texts each year to determine whether they incorporated SMSG curriculum and, if so, to 
remove any competing SMSG text.
Although the SMSG always denied that its intention was to establish a national curriculum, 
the pressures it brought on the textbook industry had the effect of forcing the adoption of the 
SMSG curriculum. The New Math was subject to considerable criticism by many parents and 
teachers who found it difficult to understand. By the end of the 1960s, it had been abandoned 
by most schools.
The work of the PSSC and the SMSG became models for other areas of curriculum develop-
ment. In 1965, under a grant from the NSF, the American Institute of Biological Sciences Cur-
riculum Study Group began work on a biological sciences curriculum, and between 1960 and 
1963 the Chemical Education Material Study Group developed a range of curriculum materi-
als for that discipline. The cooperative development by university scholars and education 
experts of curricula that stressed structure, abstraction, discovery, and curiosity tended to 
counter the complaints of anti-intellectualism that had dogged the schools for a number of 
years (Spring, 1989), but at the same time seemed designed to create a “teacher proof cur-
riculum” (Graham, 2005).
The curriculum reforms initiated by the NDEA were further stimulated by former nuclear sci-
entist and Harvard University president James Conant’s (1893–1978) widely publicized study 
of secondary education, The American High School Today (1959), also known as the Conant 
Report. Conant’s experiences both as an educator and in national defense had convinced 
him of the critical relationship between education and the welfare of the nation. According to 
Conant (1953),
If the field of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton, it may well be 
that the ideological struggles with communism in the next fifty years will be 
won on the playing fields of the public schools of the United States. (p. 62)
The primary conclusion Conant reached from his study of American high schools was that 
the number of small high schools should be drastically reduced by district reorganization 
because small schools typically were not financially able to offer quality academic and voca-
tional programs. Conant recommended that in the larger, reconstituted high schools all stu-
dents be required to take 4 years of English, 3 or 4 years of social studies, and 1 year each in 
mathematics and sciences. The more able students would take additional math, sciences, and 
foreign languages.

Section 7.8 
Curriculum Reform in the Aftermath of Sputnik
Like Rickover, Conant was concerned that the schools were not challenging the academically 
talented. However, although he did not support separate schools for those students as Rick-
over did, arguing instead that the comprehensive high school was more democratic and con-
tributed to social cohesion, Conant did propose that students be grouped by ability within the 
academic subjects. He also stressed the importance of identifying the academically gifted and 
channeling them into the university science and technology programs most needed to serve 
the national interests.
Conant played a major role in the establishment of the Educational Testing Service and 
advanced placement, and was an advocate for the use of standardized tests for college admis-
sions and for increasing the number of guidance counselors in the high schools.
Conant was also concerned with the training of teachers. To him, most teacher education pro-
grams conveyed a progressive education ideology, which on the one hand he applauded for its 
emphasis on citizenship and the need for practical courses and electives, but on the other 
hand he viewed as lacking an academically rigorous curriculum (Urban, 2013). In his The 
Education of American Teachers (1963), he proposed fewer courses in formal education stud-
ies and more coursework in general education and an academic major for all prospective 
teachers, including elementary teachers.
Unlike Bestor and some of the other school critics 
of the 1950s, Conant did not attack educators and 
did not condemn the comprehensive high school 
or suggest any radical alteration of it. As a result, 
his recommendations were seen by most educa-
tors and school boards as ideas for improvement, 
not as attempts to transform the schools, and they 
had considerable influence on educational planners and policymakers. Over the next decade, 
the number of school districts decreased from 40,520 to fewer than 18,000 (NCES, 1993), as 
many small high schools were consolidated.
New Learning Theories 
The importance of psychology to the science of education and to understanding how learning 
takes place had been advanced in the first quarter of the 20th century by Thorndike and inte-
grated with his work on intelligence testing. Thorndike developed a theory of learning that he 
labeled psychological connectionism, in which he compared the mind to a switchboard where 
connections are made between a stimulus and a response. The connection is made as a result 
of the law of effect: A reward is given when the appropriate connection is made between the 
stimulus and the response.
According to Thorndike’s stimulus–response theory, learning depends on this connection 
being made between the stimulus and the response. Thorndike’s suggestion that individuals 
differ in not only their intelligence but also in their innate ability to form connections (that is, 
to learn) played a major role in the recognition of individual differences and their importance 
in learning.
The foundation laid by Thorndike was advanced in the postwar period by Jean Piaget and 
Jerome Bruner and provided support to efforts to reform the curriculum. Piaget advanced

Education and the Red Scare 
the stage concept of cognitive child development. According to Piaget, children progress 
through four sequential stages of cognitive development that are age related and progres-
sive in the sense that one stage must be accomplished before the next: (1) sensorimotor 
(birth to age 2); (2) preoperational (2–7 years); (3) concrete organizational (7–11 years); 
and (4) formal operational (11+ years).
At each stage the child must reconstruct and inte-
grate concepts formed at previous stages. Accord-
ing to Piaget’s theory of readiness, children should 
not be introduced to new concepts until they 
have reached the appropriate stage of cognitive 
development.
Bruner also contributed to the stage theory of  
cognitive development. According to Bruner’s 
theory of cognition, learning is a process by which 
children construct new ideas and concepts based on 
their previous learning. Moreover, according to this 
theory, learning occurs in three stages of complex-
ity: enactive (action-based), iconic (image-based), 
and symbolic (language-based). Progress from one 
stage to another is influenced less by the develop-
mental level of the child (as Piaget believed), and 
more by the environment.
Like the progressives, Bruner also believed that 
children learn best when they are interested in the 
material and are engaged in active problem solving. 
And, learning is easier when teaching is concerned 
with providing an understanding of structure, the 
relationship between things, rather than simply the 
mastery of facts. According to Bruner (1960), “[A]ny subject can be taught effectively in some 
intellectually honest form to any child at any stage of development” (p. 33).
Bruner’s theories of cognition had a major impact on teachers, curriculum development, 
and policymaking in the 1950s and 1960s. He participated in the work of the NSF and was 
instrumental in the design and implementation of a number of education programs, including 
the landmark social studies curriculum development project, “Man: A Course of Study.” His 
stage theory of learning provided the rationale for the spiral curriculum sequencing pattern 
whereby subject matter is presented over a number of grades with increasing complexity and 
abstraction. Together, Bruner’s and Piaget’s theories of the way children construct knowledge 
provided the theoretical framework for the constructivist theory of cognitive development.

of communism in Eastern Europe, the victory of the communist revolution in China, and the 
June 1950 attack on South Korea by North Korea all contributed to a growing fear in the 
United States that communism posed a real threat to the country (Cole, 2009).
Right-wing extremists used the threat of communist infiltration to discredit individuals or 
ideas that they considered liberal or progressive. Public schools and universities, because 
of their role in shaping the minds and values of the young, became leading targets, if not the 
number one target, of those who were concerned about disloyalty and subversion at the state 
and local levels (Ravitch, 1983).
To a large extent, education became the battleground for some of the ideological battles being 
waged in the larger society as well. Before it was over, the Red Scare had left a significant  
and enduring mark on American education. More than 600 teachers lost their jobs after hav-
ing been accused of “un-American” activities. Hundreds more were brought before hearing 
bodies but allowed to keep their jobs.
Tenured university faculty were fired for their left-wing political activities, for refusing to 
answer questions about their relationship with the Communist party, or, in the case of 31 
California professors acknowledged not to be communists, for refusing to pledge, “I am not 
a member of the Communist party, 
or under any oath, or a party to any 
agreement, or under any commitment 
that is in conflict with my obligation 
under this oath” (Ravitch, 1983, p. 98).
Across the country Red Scare tactics 
were used in attempts to remove lib-
eral educators, and virtually all teach-
ers were intimidated and lived in fear 
and anxiety of being called before a

tee, of being arbitrarily labeled a com-
munist in the press, or of becoming the 
target of some reactionary group (Fos-

father of the atomic bomb, and Nobel

were not spared inquiries, harass-
ment, and intimidation.

nature.
study of scientists at 165 universities found 
that 25% reported exercising some form of self- 
censorship either in their private or professional 
lives (Lazarsfeld & Thielans, cited in Cole, 2009).
In towns and cities across the land, textbooks and 
curriculum materials were vigorously scrutinized 
lest any subject be included that might induce crit-
icism. Books were withdrawn from use and even burned. In Texas the legislature ordered all 
school (and university) libraries to remove any and all literature published in the Soviet 
Union. In Indiana a member of the state textbook commission pressed to have Robin Hood 
banned from the schools because the story was part of “a communist directive in education,” 
which celebrated “robbing the rich to give to the poor” (Foster, 2000, p. 1).
The Red Scare also dealt what might be considered the death blow to progressive education 
and was instrumental in moving the curriculum further to the political right (Foster, 2000). 
The critics of progressive education were effective in linking it to collectivism, and, by impli-
cation, to communism. To deflect or avoid criticism, educators “frequently played down fea-
tures of progressive education, lest they be con-
strued subversive, and vigorously emphasized the 
‘3 R’s,’ the ‘fundamentals,’ and loyalty to American 
traditions” (Foster, 2000, p. 184).
The height of the Red Scare in education came in 
1952 and 1953 with the widely publicized con-
gressional investigations of alleged subversion. 
Soon after this, the tide began to turn. The elec-
tion of the moderate Republican, Dwight Eisenhower, undermined McCarthy’s claims that the 
government was “soft on communism” (Ravitch, 1983). McCarthy’s ever more outlandish and 
unsubstantiated accusations led to his censure by the Senate in late 1954.
The courts also took a stand, overturning dismissals and declaring unconstitutional some of 
the more far-reaching state and local actions. By the mid-1950s the worst of the scare was 
over. However, the personal and professional damage done to the nation’s educators and to 
the schools where they practiced their chosen profession remained.

Conclusion 
Education was not immune to the effects of the Depression, and in some respects the response 
of many educators was similar to that of the larger population: They looked to the federal gov-

to the schools. Their major argument, the same one that has been used ever since, was that 
federal aid was necessary to overcome the educational inequalities that existed among the 
states, resulting from inequalities of resources. The argument continues that only the federal 
government can address these inequalities, and that it is in the interest of the general welfare 
for it to do so.
Whatever the merits of the argument, the federal government has continued to refuse to dis-
tribute general federal aid to education. In addition to ideological reasons related to ideas 
about the separation of powers between the federal government and the states, a major rea-
son has undoubtedly been the same one used during the Depression—the cost to the federal 
government would be too high.
The federal government did involve itself in education during the Depression, however, and in 
a way and to a degree previously not envisioned. However, much to the chagrin of educators, 
and over their protests, New Deal education funds and programs were not given directly to 
the education community. Still, New Deal programs such as the National Youth Administra-
tion and the Works Progress Administration did enable many students to stay in school and 
many teachers to draw salaries.
During and after World War II, the federal government continued its involvement, not only 
in providing financial support to education, but also in promoting a curriculum designed to 
serve national security. The progressive notion of the interests of the child guiding the cur-
riculum gave way to the interest of the state.
The postwar years also brought the federal government into the schools in a far less positive 
way. The U.S. Committee on Un-American Activities, as well as state investigatory committees, 
engaged in what is generally conceded to be a “witch hunt” to discredit educators who had 
even the slightest real or imagined connection to communism. In most cases the investiga-
tions were used to discredit liberal-leaning educators or simply those who were not liked. 
The brunt of the Red Scare was felt by more liberal educators, both in the public schools and 
in colleges and universities. They remain targets of right-wing conservative ideologues today.
For Discussion and Application 
1. Compare the high school curriculum of 1930 with the high school curriculum  
of 1960.
2. How can schools most effectively serve as initiators of social change?
3. Trace the changing involvement of the federal government in education in the  
20th century.
4. Compare the major criticisms of progressive education during the 1950s with those 
made by education critics today.
5. Interview a Depression-era student regarding the impact of the Depression on the 
students and the school he or she attended. How might you have responded to these 
circumstances?

Summary and Resources
Primary Source Readings 
In this speech before the Progressive Education Society in 1932, George S. Counts expressed both 
optimism and pessimism regarding the future and education. He underscored the great faith of 
the American people in progress and in education. He also pointed to the progressive education 
movement as a possible remedy or model for hope and change. However, Counts was a realist 
and suggested that for progressive education to be genuinely progressive, it must have direction. 
It must free itself from the influence of its liberal-minded upper-middle-class supporters, face 
each social issue courageously, establish strong community ties, and develop a realistic theory 
of welfare. 
Dare the Schools Build a New Social Order? 
George S. Counts 
Like all simple and unsophisticated peoples we Americans have a sublime faith in education. 
Faced with any difficult problem of life we set our minds at rest sooner or later by the appeal 
to the school. We are convinced that education is the one unfailing remedy for every ill to 
which man is subject, whether it be vice, crime, war, poverty, riches, injustice, racketeering, 
political corruption, race hatred, class conflict, or just plain original sin. We even speak glibly 
and often about the general reconstruction of society through the school. We cling to this faith 
in spite of the fact that the very period in which our troubles have multiplied so rapidly has 
witnessed an unprecedented expansion of organized education. This would seem to suggest 
that our schools, instead of directing the course of change, are themselves driven by the very 
forces that are transforming the rest of the social order.
The bare fact, however, that simple and unsophisticated peoples have unbounded faith in edu-
cation does not mean that the faith is untenable. History shows that the intuitions of such folk 
may be nearer the truth than the weighty and carefully reasoned judgments of the learned 
and the wise. Under certain conditions education may be as beneficent and as powerful as we 
are wont to think. But if it is to be so, teachers must abandon much of their easy optimism, 
subject the concept of education to the most rigorous scrutiny, and be prepared to deal much 
more fundamentally, realistically, and positively with the American social situation than has 
been their habit in the past. Any individual or group that would aspire to lead society must be 
ready to pay the costs of leadership: to accept responsibility, to suffer calumny, to surrender 
security, to risk both reputation and fortune. If this price or some important part of it is not 
being paid, then the chances are that the claim to leadership is fraudulent. Society is never 
redeemed without effort, struggle, and sacrifice. Authentic leaders are never found breathing 
that rarefied atmosphere lying above the dust and smoke of battle. With regard to the past 
we always recognize the truth of this principle, but when we think of our own times we pro-
fess the belief that the ancient roles have been reversed and that now prophets of a new age 
receive their rewards among the living.
That the existing school is leading the way to a better social order is a thesis which few 
informed persons would care to defend. Except as it is forced to fight for its own life during 
times of depression, its course is too serene and untroubled. Only in the rarest of instances

does it wage war on behalf of principle or ideal. Almost everywhere it is in the grip of con-
servative forces and is serving the cause of perpetuating ideas and institutions suited to an 
age that is gone. But there is one movement above the educational horizon which would 
seem to show promise of genuine and creative leadership. I refer to the Progressive Educa-
tion movement. Surely in this union of two of the great faiths of the American people, the 
faith in progress and the faith in education, we have reason to hope for light and guidance. 
Here is a movement which would seem to be completely devoted to the promotion of social 
welfare through education.
Even a casual examination of the program and philosophy of the Progressive schools, how-
ever, raises many doubts in the mind. To be sure, these schools have a number of large 
achievements to their credit. They have focused attention squarely upon the child; they have 
recognized the fundamental importance of the interest of the learner; they have defended the 
thesis that activity lies at the root of all true education: they have conceived learning in terms 
of life situations and growth of character; they have championed the rights of the child as a 
free personality. Most of this is excellent, but in my judgment it is not enough. It constitutes 
too narrow a conception of the meaning of education; it brings into the picture but one-half 
of the landscape.
If an educational movement, or any other movement, calls itself progressive, it must have 
orientation: it must possess direction. The word itself implies moving forward, and moving 
forward can have little meaning in the absence of clearly defined purposes. We cannot, like 
Stephen Leacock’s horseman, dash off in all directions at once. Nor should we, like our presi-
dential candidates, evade every disturbing issue and be all things to all men. Also we must 
beware lest we become so devoted to motion that we neglect the question of direction and 
be entirely satisfied with movement in circles. Here, I think, we find the fundamental weak-
ness, not only of Progressive Education, but also of American education generally. Like a baby 
shaking a rattle, we seem to be utterly content with action provided it is sufficiently vigorous 
and noisy. In the last analysis a very large part of American educational thought, inquiry, and 
experimentation is much ado about nothing. And, if we are permitted to push the analogy of 
the rattle a bit further, our consecration to motion is encouraged and supported in order to 
keep out of mischief. At least we know that so long as we thus busy ourselves we shall not 
incur the serious displeasure of our social elders.
The weakness of Progressive Education thus lies in the fact that it has elaborated no theory 
of social welfare, unless it be that of anarchy or extreme individualism. In this, of course, it 
is but reflecting the viewpoint of the members of the liberal-minded upper middle class who 
send their children to the Progressive schools—persons who are fairly well-off, who have 
abandoned the faiths of their fathers, who assume an agnostic attitude towards all important 
questions, who pride themselves on their open-mindedness and tolerance, who favor in a 
mild sort of way fairly liberal programs of social reconstruction, who are full of good will and 
humane sentiment, who have vague aspirations for world peace and human brotherhood, 
who can be counted upon to respond moderately to any appeal made in the name of charity, 
who are genuinely distressed at the sight of unwonted forms of cruelty, misery, and suffering, 
and who perhaps serve to soften somewhat the bitter clashes of those real forces that govern 
the world; but who, in spite of all their good qualities, have no deep and abiding loyalties, 
possess no convictions for which they would sacrifice over-much, would find it hard to live 
without their customary material comforts, are rather insensitive to the accepted forms of 
social injustice, are content to play the role of interested spectator in the drama of human 
history, refuse to see reality in its harsher and more disagreeable forms, rarely move outside

the pleasant circles of the class to which they belong, and in the day of severe trial will follow 
the lead of the most powerful and respectable forces in society and at the same time find good 
reasons for so doing. These people have shown themselves entirely incapable of dealing with 
any of the great crises of our time—war, prosperity, or depression.
At bottom they are romantic sentimentalists, but with a sharp eye on the main chance. That 
they can be trusted to write our educational theories and shape our educational programs is 
highly improbable.
Among the members of this class the number of children is small, the income relatively high, 
and the economic functions of the home greatly reduced. For these reasons an inordinate 
emphasis on the child and child interests is entirely welcome to them. They wish to guard 
their offspring from too strenuous endeavor and from coming into too intimate contact with 
the grimmer aspects of industrial society. They wish their sons and daughters to succeed 
according to the standards of their class and to be a credit to their parents. At heart feeling 
themselves members of a superior human strain, they do not want their children to mix too 
freely with the children of the poor or of the less fortunate races. Nor do they want them to 
accept radical social doctrines, espouse unpopular causes, or lose themselves in quest of any 
Holy Grail. According to their views education should deal with life, but with life distance or in 
a highly diluted form. They would generally maintain that life should be kept at arm’s length, 
if it should not be handled with a poker.
If Progressive Education is to be genuinely progressive, it must emancipate itself from the 
influence of this class, face squarely and courageously every social issue, come to grips with 
life in all of its stark reality, establish an organic relation with the community, develop a real-
istic and comprehensive theory of welfare, fashion a compelling and challenging vision of 
human destiny, and become less frightened than it is today at the bogies of imposition and 
indoctrination. In a word Progressive Education cannot place its trust in a child-centered 
school.
This brings us to the most crucial issue in education—the question of the nature and extent of 
the influence which the school should exercise over the development of the child. The advo-
cates of extreme freedom have been so successful in championing what they call the rights 
of the child that even the most skillful practitioners of the art of converting others to their 
opinions disclaim all intention of molding the learner. And when the word indoctrination is 
coupled with education there is scarcely one among us possessing the hardihood to refuse 
to be horrified. This feeling is so widespread that even Mr. Lunacharsky, Commissar of Edu-
cation in the Russian Republic until 1929, assured me on one occasion that the Soviet edu-
cational leaders do not believe in the indoctrination of children in the ideas and principles 
of communism. When I asked him whether their children become good communists while 
attending the schools, he replied that the great majority do. On seeking from him an explana-
tion of this remarkable phenomenon he said that Soviet teachers merely tell their children 
the truth about human history. As a consequence, so he asserted, practically all of the more 
intelligent boys and girls adopt the philosophy of communism. I recall also that the Methodist 
sect in which I was reared always confined its teachings to the truth!
The issue is no doubt badly confused by historical causes. The champions of freedom are obvi-
ously the product of an age that has broken very fundamentally with the past and is equally 
uncertain about the future. In many cases they feel themselves victims of narrow orthodoxies 
which were imposed upon them during childhood and which have severely cramped their

lives. At any suggestion that the child should be influenced by his elders they therefore envis-
age the establishment of a state church, the formulation of a body of sacred doctrine, and 
the teaching of this doctrine as fixed and final. If we are forced to choose between such an 
unenlightened form of pedagogical influence and a condition of complete freedom for the 
child, most of us would in all probability choose the latter as the lesser of two evils. But this is 
to create a wholly artificial situation: the choice should not be limited to these two extremes. 
Indeed today neither extreme is possible.
I believe firmly that a critical factor must play an important role in any adequate educational 
program, at least in any such program fashioned for the modern world. An education that 
does not strive to promote the fullest and most thorough understanding of the world is not 
worthy of the name. Also there must be no deliberate distortion or suppression of facts to 
support any theory or point of view. On the other hand, I am prepared to defend the thesis 
that all education contains a large element of imposition, that in the very nature of the case 
this is inevitable, that the existence and evolution of society depend upon it, that it is con-
sequently eminently desirable, and that the frank acceptance of this fact by the educator is 
a major professional obligation. I even contend that failure to do this involves the clothing 
of one’s own deepest prejudices in the garb of universal truth and the introduction into the 
theory and practice of education of an element of obscurantism.

Questions for Discussion 
1. How you would answer the question posed by the title of Count’s address, “Dare the 
Schools Build a New Social Order?” Why did the delegates greet his message with 
silence?
2. Counts believed that “an education that does not strive to promote the fullest and 
most thorough understanding of the world is not worthy of the name.” What do you 
believe Counts meant by this statement? Do you agree with his premise? Why or why 
not?
3. Counts suggested that the weakness of progressive education lies in the fact that it 
has elaborated limited theories of social welfare (that is, anarchy or extreme indi-
vidualism), which reflect the point of view of the liberal-minded upper class who are 
most apt to send their children to progressive schools. Discuss other forms of social 
welfare that might be more acceptable to members of all social classes regardless of 
income or social status.
Eleanor Gerard Sekerak, a high school teacher at the War Relocation Authority (WRA) Camp 
in Topaz, Utah, presents a moving account of her 3-year experience teaching Japanese Ameri-
can students. Upon her arrival at the internment camp, the school buildings had not been com-
pleted, there was a desperate lack of school supplies and textbooks, practically no library existed, 
and transportation was nonexistent. In spite of these challenges a successful community high 
school emerged with all the extracurricular offerings of the traditional high school. As you read  
“A Teacher at Topaz,” ask yourself how you would have fared as a student or teacher at Topaz 
High School.

A Teacher at Topaz 
Eleanor Gerard Sekerak
A number of Nisei students attended Technical High School in Oakland, the location of my 
second supervised teaching assignment. Faculty members worried aloud about their Nisei 
students. What would happen, especially to the seniors removed from classes before the end 
of the semester? What about their plans for college? I had no Nisei in my class, but during hall 
duty I had occasion to admonish, almost daily, a youngster who always dashed by as though 
on roller skates. Once while reminding him not to run in the halls, I asked his name. “Bill 
Oshima,” he told me.
The halls seemed very quiet after evacuation. From neither the teachers nor the students did 
I hear any anti-Nisei sentiment; no one identified the “enemy” with our students.
At last, the semester ended and evaluation and interviews occupied my days. One of Califor-
nia’s most prestigious districts accepted my application for a teaching position and told me 
that a contract would be mailed later in the summer. That settled, I happily departed for the 
summer as a counselor at Camp Sunset in Bartlett, Illinois, near Chicago.
However, the teaching contract did not arrive and, finally, I wrote my dean asking him to 
inquire. Back came his regrets, informing me that the district had decided to hire a man. This 
was long before the days when one could rush into court claiming discrimination!
As I wondered what to do next, a telegram arrived from Lome Bell, formerly a YMCA executive 
in the Los Angeles area and then a regional supervisor for the National Youth Administration. 
During the early summer of 1942, he had left the NYA to work for the War Relocation Author-
ity. His wire read, “If you have not yet signed a contract, will you consider a position at Topaz, 
Utah. We are in desperate need of teachers.” . . .
I had no illusions about what I would find at Topaz; Lome Bell had warned, “This is an intern-
ment camp with barbed wire and military police.” The advice at the San Francisco office of the 
WRA had been, “Take warm clothes; Utah winters are cold at 4,700 feet.” And further, “Don’t 
expect gourmet meals—you’ll eat mass cooking in a staff dining hall.” The preceding three 
months as a camp counselor proved good preparation for dorm life. . . .
Despite our location in the middle of an alkali desert, we did enjoy one great advantage—we 
didn’t displace any local residents. We were made to feel as welcome as was possible under 
the distressing conditions. We experienced none of the really nasty episodes that plagued 
some of the other centers, and I personally credit the basic goodness of our neighboring Mor-
mon residents.
Within hours of arriving at the staff women’s dorm, my trunk was delivered by a crew of 
young men, one of whom shrieked upon seeing me and dropped the trunk on his toes. It was 
my hall-runner from Technical High. He dashed away shouting, “Guess who’s here? That strict 
teacher from Tech!” By noon, the whole of Topaz knew that a California teacher had arrived.
Charles Ernst, an experienced settlement-house director from Boston, dignified and imposing 
but warm and considerate, was our first project director. He was an excellent administrator,

undaunted by the bureaucratic paperwork from Washington. With a deep concern for human 
values, Mr. Ernst kept representatives of the community in touch with developments.
Evening meetings to introduce new staff were one procedure. Never was an ordinary teacher 
made to feel more welcome. People crowded around to ask questions, shake hands, bow, and 
thank me for being there. When questioners learned that I was from Oakland and from UC, 
out of the crowd emerged classmates from University High and a smiling Hiro Katayama who 
had told us “good-bye” only six months before. Thus on my first day there were three mesh-
ings with past experiences.
The next day those teachers who had already arrived met with the administrators and other 
faculty. For some months I was the only California-credentialed teacher, giving me enormous 
prestige with the resident families. This standing also gave me an “instant” tool for discipline: 
I had only to remark to a reluctant student, “Homework not done? I think I’ll stop to talk with 
your folks on the way home,” to see an immediate transformation to eager scholar.
Most of our first-year teachers were trained in Utah; at that time a fifth year of college for sec-
ondary credentials was not required in Utah. For this reason, the Topaz residents felt short-
changed and worried about their children’s academic preparation. However, our superinten-
dent, a Utah native, had a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, and this mollified 
the parents. “Appointed,” i.e., U.S. Civil Service, faculty were augmented by the resident staff, 
many of whom had excellent backgrounds but were without formal teacher-training credits. 
Hiro Katayama joined us in this capacity, having been recruited by Henry Tani. Henry, him-
self a graduate of Stanford University in business administration, became our administrative 
assistant. He had organized the high school at the Tanforan Assembly Center and would later 
become a national staff member with the United Church of Christ. . . .
The school buildings were far from complete when I arrived. A half-block of barracks at 
each end of the project was to house the two elementary schools, called “Mountain View” 
and “Desert View.” Block 32, midway in the camp, constituted the six-year high school with a 
total anticipated enrollment of 1,720. Residents were arriving from Tanforan as fast as bar-
racks could be built. Priority for the available carpenter time was to go to the elementary 
schools; volunteer labor sped up high school construction—the students and teachers all fell 
to. Alumni still laugh at the memory of Miss Gerard, teetering precariously on a wobbly table, 
holding a sheetrock slab with both arms while hammer-wielding students banged nails on 
each edge—and presto, a ceiling!
As soon as the barracks were winterized, huge “pot belly” stoves were moved into the middle 
of a room, tables and benches brought in to accommodate thirty-six students, and we were 
in business—it was October 26, 1942. The lack of supplies was desperate, so a phone call to 
my mother (and we waited hours to place a wartime call) resulted in her calling my former 
teachers at University High. Thanks to their efforts, outdated “surplus” texts began to arrive. 
“History is history, government is government,” I sternly told my juniors and seniors, “you 
don’t need a brand-new book!” Thus were we launched on an idealistic curriculum designed 
for us by a summer-session graduate class in curriculum development at Stanford Univer-
sity. The curriculum began with the concept of the “community school,” that is, the school is 
looked upon as an extended home, the community furnishing observations and opinion. This 
approach proved most valuable for students in the vocational area, and some of our students

(those over sixteen years) were soon spending half their time in apprentice training or work 
experience. The schools in all relocation centers were to be affiliated with, and to meet the 
standards of, the states in which they were located. Utah had long been active in the voca-
tional education field, so advisory committees were organized and planning help generously 
given. Consultants from the state board of education and even the board itself visited us.
The curriculum designed for us was based on a “core” of general education in agriculture, 
commercial, or college preparatory, and, in addition, a guidance program in which every 
teacher was expected to have a role. Our sequential theme for the entire school system was 
to be “Adaptation of Our Socioeconomic Arrangements to the Control and Direction of Tech-
nological Development.” We were provided with illustrations of how to adapt this theme to 
the various grades, e.g., in grade one, “How can the yard at school be made more useful and 
beautiful?” In reality, the yard was dust (or mud) with huge piles of coal, and not a leaf could 
be coaxed from that alkali soil. In grade eleven, it was suggested, “How may the community 
take advantage of improved transportation and communication to make better living condi-
tions for its people?” Our transportation consisted of walking the gravel roads of a one-mile 
square; no one went to Delta unless by special pass and by riding in an army truck.
In the beginning, faculty meetings were an exercise in how to tolerate frustration, as we wres-
tled with the “how to” of a core curriculum in a community school with few supplies and prac-
tically no library. Then we ran into opposition from the community itself—the parents did not 
want an experimental curriculum. They wanted their children to be prepared for college and 
to lose no academic ground because of the evacuation. So, with apologies to Stanford’s Pro-
fessor Paul Hanna, we modified the curriculum procedures by combining social studies and 
English as the “core” for the 1942–43 school year.
The first semester we covered federal, state, county, and city government, and administra-
tion. An update on the creation and administration of wartime agencies was included. Then 
an intensive study of the WRA calling our project a “federally created municipality” followed. 
Staff members came to class to discuss the various phases of the administration of Topaz, and 
students took field trips and participated in an actual week of work experience in one phase 
of the community.
In May 1942 our community participation took a very active form when all seniors and their 
teachers went into the fields to plant onions and celery in areas of tillable ground scattered 
beyond the alkali deposits. Thereafter, whenever crooked celery stalks appeared on mess hall 
tables, much merriment ensued concerning whose responsibility it was to have produced 
such a deformity.
The second semester each student decided on the town in which he wished to resettle, and 
we set up a community survey of this locality and state. Using a Russell Sage publication, Your 
Community by Joanna Colcord, they sent for materials (writing model letters), did primary 
and secondary research, and wrote a term paper in college manuscript form summing up 
their results. At a recent reunion, there was amusement as alumni recounted that they had 
arrived at their chosen resettlement destinations knowing more than the natives.
Underlying all this was my personal determination that standards of behavior and of learn-
ing and performance were in no way to be lessened. As I faced my first day I wondered how 
I could teach American government and democratic principles while we sat in classrooms

behind barbed wire! I never ceased to have a lump in my throat when classes recited the 
Pledge of Allegiance, especially the phrase, “liberty and justice for all.”
In our opening discussion, the students and I agreed that the whole evacuation process had 
been traumatic but could not last forever—and we could not permit academic achievement to 
be interrupted. So they arrived at class on time, with homework completed, worked diligently, 
took their exams, and otherwise observed normal classroom standards. (We had one excep-
tion: the day the first snow fell, the California Bay Area students and their teacher rushed to 
the window to watch.) All the normal life of a typical high school was set up: school chorus, 
student newspaper, yearbook, student government, drama, athletics, dances, and the usual 
senior week activities. Borrowing caps and gowns graciously loaned by the University of Utah, 
218 seniors marched across the dusty windswept plaza to outdoor graduation exercises on 
June 25, services complete with an invocation and a begowned faculty. . . .
On one occasion, I chaperoned the first experimental group of senior girls and young women 
to work for the summer in a tomato cannery near Ogden. We started with light-hearted atti-
tudes, anticipating hard work but making money. The grim realities of migratory agricultural 
life met us when we found utterly unacceptable, unsanitary, and crowded housing conditions 
plus an employer who couldn’t or wouldn’t consider any improvements.
I had to appeal to nearby military to place me in phone contact with our project director. Upon 
hearing of the conditions, he ordered us back to Topaz, explaining to grateful parents that 
their daughters were not to be exploited.
To thank me for heading off a potentially embarrassing incident for the WRA administration, 
the director assigned my roommate and me an apartment in the new staff housing. Until that 
time we had lived in barracks rooms just as the evacuees did. Unlike some centers, at no time 
were there barriers between staff and evacuee housing. From then on, our apartment became 
a center for visitor and student meetings and parties.
My first roommate, Emily Minton, community activities director, was married at Topaz in 
December 1942. Her husband, Norman Center, arrived from San Francisco carrying Reverend 
Tsukamoto’s altar candlesticks, and Goro Suzuki sang “I’m Dreaming of a White Christmas” 
at the reception. Mary MacMillan, my second roommate, taught at the high school until she 
left for graduate work in Nashville, Tennessee. “Mary Mack,” much beloved by the students, 
would later go to postwar Hiroshima to teach. Third to move in was Muriel Matzkin, a biology 
teacher from New York. Muriel and I later went to Washington, D.C., to help close out the WRA. 
Later Muriel married Milton Shapp and became “first lady” of Pennsylvania.
Good-byes to those actually relocating to jobs out of the evacuation zone were far happier 
than parting with those destined for Tule Lake. When the first large group of families left for 
resettlement in the East, and not just on seasonal leave, staff and friends crowded around the 
gate to say their farewells. Voices raised in song—”God be with you till we meet again”—as 
tears ran unashamedly down dusty cheeks.
Happiest of all leave-takings were those when students left for college. Many educators, such 
as my faculty colleagues at Technical High, had worried about the evacuee students who were 
then in college or planning to enter in the spring of 1942, and about those who would be

Summary and Resources
graduating during the war years. During the early summer of 1942, some thirty deans and 
registrars met to consider the problem. With the eventual cooperation of over 300 colleges 
and universities, they established five requirements: (1) The student had to be accepted aca-
demically by the college while still in camp; (2) students could attend any school approved 
or “cleared” by the War and Navy departments; (3) students had to be able to provide for 
themselves financially for one year; (4) they had to be assured of a welcome in the college 
community; and (5) all students had to provide an autobiography.
The fourth stipulation created problems, as many of the large universities had war-related 
projects on their campuses; as a consequence, the need for an agency to handle a multitude 
of details became obvious. John J. McCloy, assistant secretary of war, and Milton Eisenhower, 
the first director of the WRA, requested that the American Friends Service Committee coor-
dinate the activities of all interested groups, such as the churches, the YMCA, the YWCA, and 
the Fair Play Committee. The result was the National Japanese American Student Relocation 
Council funded by church boards and two philanthropic foundations. Thomas R. Bodine was 
appointed to the position of field director, and thereby hangs a tale of true dedication and 
commitment. Tom Bodine was a member of the Society of Friends and brought to the posi-
tion the personal resources of extraordinary patience, understanding, and tremendous good 
cheer. He had charm, compassion, integrity, and aplomb with which to cajole, console, and 
counsel evacuee students and their parents, relocation center high school faculty, foundation 
boards of directors, and college presidents.
When we finally built a school auditorium at Topaz, had an adequate library, fielded uniformed 
athletic teams, and had “settled in,” Tom made us realize the stagnation of the human spirit 
that was occurring behind barbed wire. Spurred by him, we set up a student relocation office; 
our first was run very efficiently by the gracious Louise Watson. It later became a part of the 
high school, and I was called the “student relocation advisor” so as not to offend the high 
school “guidance counselor.” We organized our own scholarship fund to which both residents 
and outsiders contributed. (Once, when a dental problem forced me to make a quick train trip 
home, my only other engagement during that one-day visit was to talk with a group of teach-
ers. Asking me to please wait, they withdrew and returned with a check for a thousand dol-
lars. “If Hayward students are awarded scholarships, tell them Hayward High teachers gave 
the money, otherwise we are to be anonymous,” they said.)
The scholarships awarded, plus a $25 leave grant made when an evacuee departed camp, 
helped establish the student’s financial ability. However, jobs, housing, and community accep-
tance were the concern and responsibility of the National Japanese American Student Relo-
cation Council. By summer 1945, at least 3,000 students had been placed in various kinds of 
postsecondary education, having been relocated from all ten centers.
Topaz’s closure was official on October 31, 1945, and I left immediately for Washington, D.C. 
My responsibility there was to handle correspondence concerning student records, especially 
transcripts, as the relocated students had entered schools all over the nation. Several months 
later, when all seemed quiet on the school front, Dr. John Provinse and I went to lunch with 
an official from the National Archives. We turned over the educational records from all the 
centers, everything in good order and all students accounted for.

Answers and Rejoinders to Chapter Pre-Test
1. True. The public schools suffered far more than the colleges and universities during 
the course of the Great Depression. Public schools required public funds for their 
operation. However, lower tax revenues meant less public funds. 
2. False. The results of the Eight-Year Study conducted by the Progressive Education 
Association showed that students from experimental high schools not only achieved 
as well as students from traditional school, but also were more involved and success-
ful in artistic and cultural activities. 
3. False. It was the social reconstructionists who criticized the schools for not taking 
the lead in reconstructing society and building a new social order. The essentialists 
argued that school should teach basic subjects and emphasize core democratic values. 
4. True. Life adjustment education was a proposal to formulate a program adjusted 
to the interests, efforts, and probable future activities of those 60% of students not 
entering vocational training or preparing for college.
5. True. Bruner’s theories of the way children construct knowledge (cognition) 
provided the theoretical framework for the constructivist theory of cognitive 
development.
Rejoinders to Chapter Post-Test
1. For the first 2 years following the stock market crash, most school superintendents 
viewed the current economic condition as a temporary storm they could weather by 
creative retrenchment and greater compactness and efficiency.
2. The Depression started with the collapse of the stock market and was quickly 
followed by major problems in the banking system, leading many banks to fail.

Summary and Resources
Conant Report James Conant’s study of 
secondary education, The American High 
School Today, in which he recommended 
larger high schools and increased academic 
requirements.
Eight-Year Study A study conducted by the 
Progressive Education Association to dis-
cover the effectiveness of progressive edu-
cational approaches in preparing students 
for college. The results found no difference 
between progressive and traditional schools.
essentialists Adherents to a philosophy of 
education that advocates that the primary 
purpose of education is to train the intellect 
and teach students the culture and tradi-
tions of the past.
G.I. Bill The Servicemen’s Readjustment Act 
(1944), which provided education benefits 
to veterans of World War II and was later 
extended to veterans of the Korean, “Cold,” 
and Vietnam wars.
Production by businesses contracted sharply, and this led to unemployment 
rates near 25%. High unemployment was a major obstacle facing the Roosevelt 
administration. 
3. The National Youth Administration provided part-time employment to needy high 
school and college students to help them continue their education. The Public Works 
Administration built public libraries and schools. The Civil Conservation Corps 
employed youth to work on conservation projects, and the Works Projects Adminis-
tration hired teachers to teach adult literacy.
4. The strong demand for industry workers during the Second World War meant that 
wages were relatively high, typically higher than the wages a teacher could earn. 
This contributed to the overall teacher shortage during the war years. 
5. John Collier was convinced that Native American policy should focus on renewing 
Indian sovereignty, establishing economic independence, and recognizing and valu-
ing Indian culture and language.
6. Social reconstructionists believed the role of the school was to guide students in 
using the tools of the scientific method to study and solve the “real world” problems 
facing our democratic society.
7. Financial support for schools, which was already decreased during the Depression, 
was further reduced during World War II. Schools struggled to meet both normal 
education demands and the demands of preparing students to help the war effort. 
8. One of the ways colleges and universities attempted to meet the manpower demand 
of the war effort was by acceleration: moving to four quarters or three semesters per 
year and expanding to a six-day instructional week.
9. Beginning in 1944, the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act (the G.I. Bill) provided ben-
efits for World War II veterans to further their education at any level. The effect was 
to initiate a popularization of higher education. G. I. Bill benefits were later extended 
to veterans of the Korean, “Cold,” and Vietnam wars.
10. The 1957 launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union suggested that American students 
would need more rigorous math and science curricula, as well as increased preparation 
in foreign languages, if the country was to compete effectively with the Soviets. The cur-
riculum reforms were not mandated by the federal government, and funding came from 
the National Science Foundation and the National Defense Education Act.
