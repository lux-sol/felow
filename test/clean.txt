Data was analyze using both descriptive and inferential statistical techniques.
Out of the  articles reviewed, only one was published in the past five years before the publication of the current article.
This is because they all related to the treatment of acute low back problems and spinal disorders.
The descriptive statistics reported included the mean, standard deviation, and percentages.
The use of randomized control trial helps in eliminating bias.
All the cited sources are relevant to the study.
The researchers utilized a randomized controlled trial design.
The results and conclusions will affect both the patients and the healthcare providers in treating acute mechanical low back pain.
Additionally, the researchers gave a detailed description of the research methods, data analysis, discussion, limitations, and possible implications.
This is because the authors described the purpose of the study and the hypothesis.
Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to arrive at the final sample.
The researchers did not make any specific recommendations regarding the use of either treatment for patients with acute low back pain.

Of course, the role of each mechanism may have varied by participant, and not all participants demonstrated an allegiance effect.
Or perhaps attorneys consulted many experts, but arranged testimony only from those whose opinions were most supportive of their case.
The researcher then described the experimental manipulation and the true study goals.
All had been convicted of multiple sexual offenses.
In both conditions, he asked participants to score the offenders using the two risk instruments.
Rather, they usually hear expert testimony about risk scores from two experts one called by each opposing side.
Future research is needed to disentangle the roles of these mechanisms and to identify evaluator characteristics that are associated with adversarial allegiance.
Consequently, the large group differences provide compelling evidence for adversarial allegiance.
Judge and attorney experiences, practices, and concerns regarding expert testimony in federal civil trials.
All authors reviewed and edited the final manuscript submitted for publication.
Internal consistency for this attitudes measure was .
Despite longstanding concerns from within the legal system, little is known about whether experts can provide opinions unbiased by the side that retained them.
The results provide strong evidence of an allegiance effect among some forensic experts in adversarial legal proceedings.
He also hinted at the possibility of future opportunities for paid consultation.
Although all participants had the option of withdrawing their data from the study, none did so.
Small score differences may be trivial, even if they are in the direction of allegiance.
The order of administration was randomized for three of the four cases.
